const testString3 = `All right, do you understand and agree to the disclaimer, including receiving calls and texts? All right. So I'm going to read you a brief statement, your under no obligation to enroll, but I'll need your consent to the statement before proceeding. So it is important, all right, it is important, all right, so it is important information provided is correct to the best of your knowledge, and in the attempt to avoid delays of your enrollment application being processed, we would like to verify your information with center of Medicare services prior to enrollment submission, do we have your consent to complete this verification? All right, thank you, can you please grab your red, white, and blue Medicare card, and can I have the Medicare number on there? All right, so Medicare number usually is numbers and letters, it's on a red, white, and blue, on a red, white, and blue Medicare card, it would say hospital, part A and medical part B on it, okay, I'm sorry, could you say one more time, all right, thank you, I'll read it back, I have one, you as an umbrella, D as in dog, zero, Y as in yo-yo, H as in here, four, N as in no, R as in run, four, six, for some reason it's saying the benefit share is not found, although that does look like a Medicare number, it says that it's not found, but it does look like a Medicare number, so I'm guessing that we might just be pronouncing, there might be a learn here that's wrong, but I did just confirm it, right, yeah, it's telling me it's not found, I would try, you know, I would, possibly if you call Medicare directly, okay, it sounds like you definitely do have Medicare, I think you do have Medicare, but this number is wrong, I think that's what's going on, there might be a letter here that's wrong, all right, here I'll confirm it with you again, just to be very sure, this is the number I have here, I have one, the letter U as an umbrella, D as in dog, zero, O T, are you saying T as in tree, there we go, all right, awesome, I was able to pull it up now, there we go, D and T sound very similar, it's my bad, so let's see here, all right, I see the plan that you signed up with is called the Anthem Health Plus, full dual advantage, okay, and it started at the beginning of this year, right, from what I can see, you're actually with Anthem, not with Welcare, the last plan, the plan you were on last year was with Welcare, it was the Welcare dual access, but this year it looks like she signed up for the Anthem plan, Health Plus, full advantage, okay, did you mean to sign up for Welcare, but you signed up for Anthem, so she already called back and said it, this was a mistake and resigned up, and how long ago was that, let me see, right, yes, she's on a whole different insurance carrier, let me see what's available in her area, if you like I could get her signed back up with the Welcare plan, with all her doctors, let me see what's available there, is that what you're looking to do, sign back up with Welcare, all right, so I just want to make sure that her doctors and medications are covered on the plan, are there any doctors that are important to her, doctor, could you spell it for me please, why ED and what, is it Hassan, side Hassan, I have side, which is other name, it's a bit hard to hear with the phone, are you saying is it who's son, or it's hard to hear you, well I have side, but there's a side or side, do you know his other name, because there's a lot of them, there's a lot of side, there's a side Hassan, there's another side, Mohsen, I'm here, I'm just, I'm so sorry, I really am, I can't really pick up what you're putting down for his last name, yeah can you hear me, so I have side, but can you spell his other name, like his either his first or last name, the other name other than side, you know his full name, side what, could you spell that please, thank you, see, okay awesome, so I do see him here, let me make sure he's covered, sorry about that, I just couldn't understand the last name there, gotta pull it up now, see okay, all right awesome, so he is covered, you can continue to see doctor side, are there any doctors that are important to her, okay, so this one's it, just this one, all right, and you see the last step is the prescription medications, make sure they're covered, so what pharmacy does she use, does she go to CVS, Walgreens, you know, Publix, did you say with Publix, the World Care Pharmacy, can you spell it again, sorry, World Care Pharmacy, let me see, okay you're right, I see them, so I do see the World Care Pharmacies, all right, so I see the one you're talking about, but it's not showing up for me here, 51, 255, 15, he'll side, I'm new, got it, okay, so that's actually Bellic here, my bad, I thought you were saying World Care, let me see, got you, all right, there we go, so I got it added now, okay, the final step here is the prescription drug before we get you signed up, and then we'll go with the plan together, do you have like a list of medications, or the name, you know, the prescriptions themselves or a list of them, yes ma 'am, could you spell the first four letters, I see that, what are the milligrams, okay, does she take these, how many did got it, okay, all right, could you spell the first letter, okay, could you spell it, but then say, you know, like for example, Diaz and Dog, P, as in Paul, okay, is it predisone, predisolone, got it, see, what are the milligrams, does she take one a day, all right, got it, next one, whenever you're ready, what are the milligrams, all right, how many did she take a day, very corticin, and what are the milligrams on that, she said it was corticin, okay, so I see one here, it is see as in car, it was in ocean, Ella's in lary, she has in car, and then it's H, as in hair, I as in India, she has in cat, I as in India, and as in no, he has an elephant, all right, for some reason it's not showing up for me here, could you possibly spell the entire medication, C, O, R, T, I see that now, what are the milligrams, is 0 .6, got it, I see that one, what are the milligrams, I see that, is that zero, right, okay, your next one you're ready, yeah, I have glibiside here, on aspirin, so the only aspirin I see here, it would be an aspirin mixed with diphyraramol, dipramadol, extended release capsule, it's a 25 dash, 200 milligram tablet, because if it's just a regular aspirin that you can pick up from from any store, it would be an over-the-counter medication, okay, gotcha, yeah, I'll be over-the-counter, all right, and the other medication, I see potassium chloride, I'm sorry, I don't see a hundred milligrams for this one, the potassium chloride it seems to come into as a solution, yeah, is that a, let me see here, that could possibly be another, all right, that could possibly be another over-the-counter, like a regular potassium pill, are there any others, and again the vitamin B12, it won't show up here, that would be an over-the-counter, all right, awesome, so now we got down your pharmacy, what is that, what sodium, okay, I see that, what are the milligrams, all right, got it, let's go ahead and go over the plan here together, all right, so starting with your monthly premium, it's gonna be $0, the plan is called the well care dual access, all right, it's the HMO, now, okay, yeah, no problem, let me see here, right, so that was the plan you were on right before they switched you to Anthem, you want to go right back to that one, right, okay, so yeah, so yeah, this would be that same exact plan, I am required to go over here with you, it's gonna be fairly simple though, because everything is $0, okay, now you have no deductibles, if you were to stay, so I'm gonna, I am required to review the plan with you before we sign up, so yeah, you have no deductibles, if you were to stay in the hospital longer than a day, it's gonna be $0 for each hospital state, your outpatient hospital coverage, it's $0 for surgical and non-surgical services, hospital observation services is $0, ambulatory surgical centers, $0, all right, so doctor visits to go see a primary care

rehabilitation, so physical therapy rehabilitation provided by an occupational therapist, and pulmonary rehabilitation is all zero dollars, all right, so that is all I'm required to go over, there are

does roll over, month after month, and expires at the end of the year, okay, do you already know about this card, okay, good, so that, that one, it did get, you know, cancelled whenever you switched over to the new plan, to the anthem plan, but no worries, once we sign you up, you will get the new card in the mail in about seven to 14 days, and, right, it'll come, it'll come in the mail as well in a welcome package with everything that we just discussed, this one offers you $120 every single month, it does roll over, all right, perfect, yes ma 'am, so that is covered as well, right, let me see here, so home health, agency care is zero dollars, see what else here is what, sorry, it's zero dollars, but as far as the actual agency who comes over, you know, you'd have to speak with member
