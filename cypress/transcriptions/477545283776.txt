Agent-Channel 1(RIGHT):  Hello. Thank you for calling Ralker Medicare. This call will be recorded for quality and training purposes. My name is Lydia Cepington, I'm a licensed insurance agent, and how can I assist you today? Well, we have a blue course, a blue course division, but I am the developer division, but we have everything. They're a very large company. Is this where you need to get, or can you tell me how we can help? Well, because we do have blue course, blue-shere division, absolutely. It's a blue course, blue-shere, it's carried by hundreds of different companies. It's not one place, so anybody who is licensed and handled and assigned with blue course, blue-shere, we all have, we all work with blue course, blue-shere. So if you tell me how we can help, I can assist you. What is it that you need? Yes? Well, Obamacare is for under 65. Are you under 65 or because this is Medicare? Are you on Medicare? Your disability, so you are on Medicare. Okay, so then that you wouldn't have Obamacare. That's for people who are not on Medicare. It's one or the other. So if you have Medicare, that's not what you would have. Okay, it's actually better for you to because Medicare will give you a lot more benefits than then, then, well, listen, it depends on your particular situation. But in general, Medicare has special programs of people who have, for example, have Medicare, A and B, and they also have Medicaid. Can you tell me about your situation and see how I can help? Yes, of course. Okay. Well, I can look up if you have some other, it's not only Q and B, there are a lot of different levels. There are some, I believe, eight levels in all. I'm sorry, you have SLMB. Okay, okay, okay. Well, what happens is that even with SLMB, Medicare, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has special programs that are called dual eligible special needs plans. And they give you a lot more benefits than if you just have to separate the Medicare, A and B and the Medicaid, and they even give you money every month. Okay, well, I can look up if you qualify for, for, with SLMB has a lot of programs that are called dual eligible special needs plans. And you can get a lot of additional benefits with that. I'll be able to look that up for you if we have something like that. Okay, absolutely. Can I just say your first name and last name? Well, what a beautiful name. Okay, okay. And unusual, beautiful. And how about your date of birth? 1971, you were a young lady. I could be your grandmother almost. I'm 70. I was born in 54. So time flies. So enjoy it. So how about your zip code? What zip code are you calling me from? Zero to one. Okay, thank you very much for that. So, so this is what I feel has to do. First of all, I would like to know what, what were you originally looking for? What kind of services you're missing? I'm sure that something prompted your course. I want to make sure that you, I look for exactly what you need because that's my job. It's just people with finding a plan that meets their needs. And it can have a lot of different things in it. And amongst them, particularly with the dual eligible special needs plan, there, there's some assistance like rental assistance or or healthy food or even for utilities and things like that. And at the same time, I like to know if dental is important to you because every plan is different. They have different future. They all cover the same basic benefits and the same basic services because it's Medicare, you know, but, but you know, they are kind of customized to people's needs like some people really need transportation. Some people must have seven thousand hours in hearing aids. So, then, you know, that's what we focus on. Some people have a lot of dental work and they, they want unlimited dental or something like that. Can you tell me what things are important to you? Okay. Okay. So you have a dentures. Okay. I got it. Okay. Absolutely. Well, you know, we can see which one because sometimes you don't need the unlimited dental because some people have like a lot of teeth have to be pulled and they have a lot of work and all that. So, if you need just like the bottom plate, the set can be anywhere from 1200 to 3000 dollars and so you might not need the unlimited. So we can focus more on how much money we can get you. Does that make sense? Okay. Okay. All right. Absolutely. So, of course, of course, that's all plans have that. Did you have like a copay or something? Are you trying to reduce your copay? Is that all I see what you mean? Okay. Okay. Absolutely. All right. So, so let me do that. We don't have every plan available in your zip code because nobody has, you know, every company has contracts with Medicare for different plans, but we're a very big company. So, I'm sure that we can find you what you need. But so, but this is the in case we get disconnected. I just want to make sure I have your telephone number. Is it 5, 7, 3, 7, 1, 8, 2, 3, 3, 5? No, that's not what you're calling me for. Oh my goodness. Okay. You know what? Something else popped up. It is I have like two big screens here and I'm looking at the wrong thing. It's my fault. 3, 4, 6, 7, 7, 3, 1, 8, 6, 5. Is that is that correct? 3, 4. Okay. I apologize for that. I have too many things going on. Let me create a computer so I can just focus on your record. And so, let me tell you what I have to do. So, I'm going to look in and use the board and full of the plans are available. There are dual electrical special needs plans and we can discuss them. And while I'm doing that, the Medicare mandate that I play a recording is very, very brave 90 seconds. But the reason why they make us do that is because they don't want people to feel pressured. So, it will tell you that you do not have to give me any information, any medical or health information, which I will never ask anyway. We don't do that. And that you do not have to sign up for anything. You do not have to enroll in anything. And you certainly don't have to. If you had a plan, but you said you don't, but if you had a plan, you don't have to change anything. So, we're just here to give you information. And you know, that kind of stuff. So, I have to play it because otherwise they won't let me go on. It only takes a minute and a half. And I'll be right back and tell you what I have. And then they can discuss those plans and see which ones would be most suitable for you. Okay. So, let me just put on the recording. Thank you so much. Here it goes. Tuesday, January 23rd, 2024.

Yes, so I just want to make sure you heard that. Okay, and so 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, I have 13 plans here and four of them are dual eligible special needs plans. So I'm just putting them side by side and comparing and no, no, no, I can assure you that we have plans that will meet your needs, I can assure you. So this is my first level of where I'm looking and if I need some assistance, I get that but a very huge company with contract with Medicare since 2006, we have more things that you're going to be looking for. So we will take care of it and we'll get you the transportation and get you some money and make sure that you have the patient coverage and everything that you need and you won't have to pay too much for it. So let me just see this one thing. This has up to 48 trips. How much transportation do you need? Can you tell me how often? Okay, all right, absolutely. So, yeah, absolutely. Well, this has 48 one way, so this would have 24. Let me find your 30, just bear with me. Okay. And let me, I need a little help here. So let's see. No, not too very, we'll take care of it for you because there's a lot of things that we can absolutely, absolutely, I do understand. So let's see. No, absolutely. I mean, I understand that's why I'm asking you questions because I want to make sure that we find you what you need. You know, and not something else and don't you just say that people say, well, I don't have this, but I have that. I like to listen and make sure that we address your needs. Okay. So bear with me for a second. I will put you on hold for 20 seconds, no more than that. Okay. And I'll be right back and absolutely. Okay. So, because I'm looking at it says it has up to 48, which is only 24 trips and several of the other ones though. And I honestly, I, I, I redefine you exactly what you want, but let's, do you have your Medicare number so I can verify your level and eligibility? Is the red, white and blue card? If you don't have it, I can look it up. You don't? Okay. Okay. I can look it up. Don't worry about it. I can look it up and just open and go up my other program to, to, to find you. And yeah. So, let me just go in here and enter your number. Is 7, 8, 4, 3, 6. So, let me enter your information and I can look up your Medicare number here in the system. Okay. Now, that's 48 one way trips. So, that's really is basically, I don't know why they do it with one who goes one way. You know, but that's the way they do it. And it's 24 run trip. Okay. But let me just verify your information here. Right? Yes. So, that's for immune problems, right? I mean, I, I have that. So, okay. So, let me put in your name. E, N, Q, U, I, N, E, T, T, E, first name and last name is cool. No. I didn't do it right. Okay. Okay. Yes. And that's what I have. I'm sorry. I have a little bit of an accent. So, it's A as an apple and that's a Nancy. Q as in queen, U as in Utah, I as in India and as in Nancy, E as in Ellen, T as in Tom, T as in Tom, E as in Ellen. Is that correct? No. Until that time.

Sorry, making a lot of mistakes this morning. That's not like me. I'll show you. Okay. So, okay. So, I got your information. And I see that you do have the LIS. And I will have to put that information on the other system for the Medicaid information coming up because this is their Medicare. All right. So, let me pull that one up. And I have to read your bill statement. It's required. So here it goes. You are on the no obligation to enroll, but I will need you consent to the statement before proceeding with the plan presentation. It is important that the information provided is correct to the best of your knowledge in an attempt to avoid delays of your enrollment application being processed. We would like to verify your information with Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services prior to enrollment submission. Do we have your consent to complete this verification? Please note that during this validation, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services may provide additional details regarding your eligibility, which could assess your license agent which is in the plan that best fits your needs. So, with your permission, I'm going to enter your Medicare number right here so we can get to the Medicaid information. Okay. T, the second, it's 2, WP9, T, 0, 6, D, 1, 2. Okay. So, I'm going to go ahead and enter it all right. Thank you. Okay. Okay. So, I have confirmation that it is true that you have a certain level of Medicaid and then I have to find out what level that is and that your address is at 52 or 2. You do very straight Houston, Texas, 77021 and you had Medicare since 2007 and let me look up the plan that it shows that you are in a plan right now. Let me see which one that is 4514, 014. Okay. 014. Okay. So, you just have a regular plan. You do not have a dual eligible special needs plan. Okay. So, hopefully we can do better than that because I'm looking at all the duals. So, now let me get to Medicare level. Sorry, there are so many steps to this. So, just be with me. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. This is good. Again, 77021. Medicare, Medicare, okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.
