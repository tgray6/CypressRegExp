Your primary doctor would be. Right. Everybody. Yeah. It has been that we weren't quite where we needed to be. And it has definitely improved a lot. Right. Right. At least you know what was on the that how it was. Yes. And on this. Absolutely. On this plan, your primary doctor would be zero dollar copay and your specialist would be $50. Emergency room is $100. Let's see here. You're hearing services. You would get your routine hearing exam and you're hearing aid fitting and evaluation. And you would get $350 per year every year for hearing aids. Your dental service, you would get. Let's see what it has on dental. Yeah, it does. You get your preventative services that is zero dollar copay.

So you do get all those. You can. Yes, ma'am, you sure can. As long as they take it is, I believe they do, but you have to look. It's the silver and fit. You'd have to ask them if they take it. But I'm pretty sure they do. Tell me what. Tell me what the primary doctor's name is that you go to see. Okay. Okay. Hmm. Okay. Suvific. Hmm. Okay. Let's take a look. She doesn't take well care. Nope. I mean, you can still see her with a PPO. It's just going to cost you a little bit more to go to the doctor because she would be out of network. She would be, let me look here and see. $25. Sure, let me look and see what we got. Let's look. Okay. Let's look and see. Jose Lopez. Yes, he does take it. I mean, we can put him as your doctor. That's what you want, for sure. Okay. Yeah, we can still put him on there and then you can just let him know like, hey, the doctor that you gave me or, you know, whatever, they don't take it. So, who do you suggest? You know, if he, you know, if he is retiring or something like that, yeah, absolutely, you can do that. Absolutely, you sure can. Yeah. What about medications? Do you take any medications on a regular basis? Okay. Come on, computer. Okay. S-a-teleprion. Okay. On the B-aproprien, what dosage do you take on that one? Okay. Gotcha. Okay. And what else? Okay, let's see. Let's see if this is it. Okay. Gotcha. Okay. I think that's all of them. Okay. Let me take a look at these and see what they're going to run, which you probably know if you had it and take the same medications. But let's make sure. Zero dollars, zero dollars and four dollars and 27 cents. So, yeah, not bad. Not bad at all. Yeah, no, no, no. Which pharmacy do you use? I'm sorry to make it. Some of them have changed. Yes, this one in particular has not changed. No, it correct. Yes, it'll be the same one that you had. Absolutely. It'll work just like the one you had was working. Yes, ma'am. That's it. I understand. I understand completely. You're like, that's what I need is something I understand because. Well, they just change so often and just it it's hard to. Yeah, it's really hard for me. So I understand. Right. She has Medicaid and Medicare as well. Yeah. Yeah, with Medicaid and Medicare, a lot of people do go with them because they do tend to give the most out of anybody. But like you said, it's not everything they always say is true. You know, and that tends to hurt people in the long run. So that's a hard situation, for sure. Oh, gotcha. Gotcha. Yeah. And that's yeah, exactly. Okay. So I'm going to place you on a brief hold and I'm going to get approval on your account to get you enrolled. Do you receive text messages to your phone? Okay. So that's how I will send you the enrollment. So give me just a couple of minutes. And let me get this approved. And then I'll be right back. Okay. Hang on. All right, my dear. I just sent you a text message. Let me know when you receive that. Okay. It'll have a link. Okay. It'll have a link that's attached to it. If you'll look at that. Okay.

If I could spell his name correctly, that would help. Yes. Exactly. And I'll put an X, but I'll change that. His NPI number. And then if you'll answer the four questions underneath that. Okay. If you've seen him in the past, I would say yes. Okay. Okay. And then the bottom question, this is a zero dollar premium. But we have to ask you just in case you have any bills from Medicare. If you have a latent enrollment penalty anyway. I always tell everybody to put coupon book. So if you get a bill from Medicare, you'll know exactly what it's for. And then hit next step. Yes, ma'am. At the very top, it's going to say preferred language. If you'll click on that box and answer that question. Okay. And then it's going to ask you what your race is. And then right beside it, it's going to ask you if you're Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish, origin, if you'll answer that question. Not that you click on it. Uh-huh. Okay. Ask, answer the Hispanic one first and then see if it'll let you go back to that one. Okay. See if it'll let you put that on the. Still won't let you. Okay. What I can always change that, that's not a problem. Okay. Okay. Well, there you go. It's showing. It's showing your both of them. That's honestly that it won't change anything. But I can change that. That's not a problem. Uh-huh. In the middle of the page, it'll say my plan's important information. There's an arrow pointing. It says, I, I'm sorry. Yes, go down a little bit more. Uh-huh.

But if you have a doctor's appointment before then, that's not a problem. We can get that taken care of for you. I'm just holler at me.

Customer-Channel 0(LEFT):  Okay, I'm calling you guys, I was well here last year and I learned it over to United Health, thinking I get a better plan for dental and stuff, but they lie to me. So I end up going to you know, to your health, but you know, to help lie to me and tell me that I would have free, um, that I would have, um, I would certainly have my medic here, what doesn't spend, what is it called, um, to get back program. That would still be on the get back program and I would have dental coverage and yada yada and I didn't. So I get a call from, or I get a letter from Social Security stating that, um, I no longer have a give back program, you know, so I called up United Health, looked to someone else and they said, oh no, we don't offer that. I'm like, what? Well, I was doing that. I would have stayed with well here. So I don't know, I don't know if we could take me back or was.
