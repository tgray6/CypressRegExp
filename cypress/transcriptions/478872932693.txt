Agent-Channel 1(RIGHT):  Hello, thanks for calling well care medic care. I'm Elizabeth the licensed agent. How can I help you? Oh, no. Okay, certainly and you mean you don't have to share with me but what was wrong with your provider you said United Health Care? What have they done? Okay, and you are getting those services before with well care no problem? Wow, okay. Yeah, I'll definitely help you with that. All right. Sounds good. Well, you haven't been gone long so it shouldn't be hard to get everything back up and running. Um, and what is your first and last name please? Okay, thank you. And your date of birth, Mr. Norman. All right, perfect. And let's see, do you get any extra help from Medicaid or just with Medicare? All right, perfect. And then I do need to let you know this call is recorded for quality and training purposes and also that we don't offer every plan in your area but we of course offer all the well care plan. All right, so do you want to go back to your same plan or should we take a look and see if maybe there's a different plan that might fit your needs better? Well, actually not taking a look there's one advantage plan in your area so that's probably going to be the one with well care. So how about we stick with that one? All right, sounds good. And then do you have a primary care doctor? I know you haven't been gone long but I still want to make sure that they're taking well care and also I'll put their name on your new card in AHEC. Okay. And that's the name of the practice not of the doctor, right? Okay, I'm going to try to first see if I can find the doctor that you actually see sometimes they do come up in the doctor's search but then you're right other times I have to look for their primary care they're under. Okay, let's see if Google's my friend will go off at LAB in the air. JT, LeBler. Okay. King Creek. Okay. There's Mayhack. Okay, I see it. And then the spelling LAB-R-U-Y-E-R-E. That's it. Okay, so that doctor doesn't show up and the doctor look up so probably have to put that one you said called Dona was about how you thought it was like. Even if you know the phone number actually maybe I can find the phone number here. Okay. D-A-N-E-T-O-A-N-D-O-N-E-T-O. Okay. Mic or Michael, right? Let me just give him me a hard time right now. So you went there before with your well care plan just recently, right? Yeah, he's not coming up. Let me go to a different site. I just prefer this one but I'll go to a well care site see if he comes up on that one. So I just want to make sure because sometimes the doctors do change networks as well so you know I don't want you to be bouncing around and you know upset everywhere you turn so I'm going to make sure that this is going to work out stuff. Okay. Guilmer. And then the first thing what is it? Okay. Yeah that one comes up. So we got yeah Benjamin Gilmer. Okay. And then the address that it has for him is in Hendersonville. Henderson Gilmer. All right. I'm just going to organize here. And then is it part of the oh my gosh Pishhag network P-I-S-G-A-H network? Okay. I mean I'm just going to make sure the doctors have code here because he only shows one address and it's an Asheville. So maybe I should put in the zip code of where he is. Yeah. 2872. Okay. He came up again. He came up again but with that same address. So let me make sure the doctor code matches now. Oh yeah I was searching over here too. Let me do this one. Yeah he keeps coming up on the Hendersonville. I wonder if that's their main location. Yes. Okay. It keeps giving me their address there. So I'm able to confirm that because it doesn't even show me that address that you're reciting to me when I'm looking up their information on my doctor's search here. But I am able to confirm that Dr. Benjamin Gilmer does take the plan. And then do you have any other doctors, dentists or providers? And what was the first name? Stephen. Okay. Because I do see it's even Stephen Saunders that he's a doctor and other dentists. Okay. I knew so this dentist under a bulk hair before too. Okay. I'm going to find their phone number. Search that way. Sometimes it's easier. I think I've got it here. Yeah. I'm pretty quick at finding those numbers. Let me switch this back to your zip code because I bet this is in a different location. That doesn't want to bring anyone up for me either. SAU and D-E-R-S Stephen. No, no. I kind of was looking like that Dr. Saunders doesn't take the bulk hair anymore or the dentist Dr. Saunders. Yeah. I wonder if he's still in practice there. Okay. He didn't close or retire. But they have the same listening, of course, right? Yeah. These guys don't come up at all. I'm even looking outside of bulk hair. I've got a different site where I can look at all the different carriers and what doctors take their plans. And they're not super far away from your zip code area. Are they? Okay. Yes. I don't see any Saunders. Come on. Oh, here's one. Here's one. Horace Saunders H-O-R-A-C-E. That's the first Saunders dentist I see. I had to look 75 miles away. Let's see what the address says. M Stephen Saunders. I wonder what the M's for. Let's see. Yeah. These guys don't even come up. I wonder if they're not taking Medicare anymore. Yeah. They don't want to come up at all in my doctor searches here. Yeah. Not even if I just do Saunders and I go, I have to open up over 100 miles away. And I still. Horace is the only one. I did try it that way. Is it the one that is ends in 6060? Yeah. That one. It didn't bring up anyone. Normally that does work. That's my preferred way if I have the phone number. But even when I put in the phone number, it brought up absolutely nothing. I feel like they might have made a change. But yeah, and they took your well care, or they took the United Health here? The well care? Well, how about this? Why don't we call them and see if they take it? Is this a dentist you like really need to keep seeing, or would you be willing to see a different dentist? Okay. So let's, I'll give them a call. I'll bridge the call together. Let's just ask them what they take. We'll get a verbal confirmation. And then that should be all right then. All right. So I'm going to call this number. There'll be some hold music while I get it going. Oh, and do you want to take my name and number two? That way if we get disconnected, do you know how to get back to me? All righty. You're on the road? It's 844-981-1407. All right, and I'm going to lose a bit. Yep. All right, there'll be hold music and then I'll put the call together. If they have me press one for this and two for that, I'm going to do that first and then I'll connect this. Okay. Perfect then. Just to click hold. Hi, ma'am. Would you be able to verify what type of insurance doctor Sanders takes? Yeah. Thank you. So specifically, I'm wondering if he takes the well-care, Medicare Advantage plan. We do not. Okay. And then do you take any Medicare? Okay. Well, if the Advantage plan has like a different dental carrier like dental quest or something like that, do you take that or just not at all? I want it, but we're not in network. Oh, okay. Okay. Are you talking about your last visit? What's the key ball? Involves? Just what it says involves? Uh-huh. Hold on, just a minute. That might be the dental for a well-care. Yeah, that's the dental that well-care has. The dental vendor is involved. Yeah, so we'll follow it. Where does that in network? So if it's in HMO, so this is what he had before when he went to you. So can he expect the same type of services when it comes to billing? Yeah, so as long as you guys cover out of network benefits, yes. Okay. All right. I understand. I got it. All right. Thank you. All right. Thanks. Bye. Bye. All right. Well, let's check this out. So do you have your Medicare ID number from the red, white, and blue card? I just want to look into your history. So make sure you had this same plan that well-care's got up right now. And don't have that. Okay. No worries. I got ways around it. Yeah. That was strange. Let's see. I'll need that history to be able to make a good call here on this dentist, but I'm just going to note that evolve in here. Involve ENVOLVE. Mm-hmm. Okay. Very nice. All right. Go ahead. All right. Perfect. Just a quick little search here. Okay. Okay. All right. I think I'm piecing it together. All right. So you're still the county is bun comb. Correct? Bun comb. All right. Let me just make sure because I think that well-care change the type of plans they have available in your area. I just want to make sure I got it all right here before I start talking. Okay. Did you move recently too? Did you move at the beginning of the year or you're in the same place? Okay. So here's what we got going on. It looks like well-care doesn't offer. You had the well-care give back plan last year. And it was the well-care give back PPO. And you probably had to change because it looks like that plan is no longer offered in your area, unfortunately. So do you remember getting a notice that said, you know, you have to make an election or something like that? No. Okay. Well, it looks like that plan had ended because I've got everything right here, the right county, the right zip code, and they don't offer a PPO in your area anymore. They only have the HMO. So that's what the dentist was saying is if you have out of network coverage, then they can bill it. But you would be an out of network patient and probably have some co-pays. But with an HMO, there's no out of network availability. So, sorry, Mr. Norman, my connection cut out for a moment. Did you say something? The primary care is still good. So

Customer-Channel 0(LEFT):  Elizabeth, good day. Tom Norman. Elizabeth, I was with well care and then after, when it came time for enrollment, I spoke to, oh, there it is, good. I spoke to somebody from e-health and they suggested I change over to the United AARP. Let's just say that I'm beyond disgusted with them after just a month. So I want to come back to, I want to come back to well care. Well, basically, I never had difficulty with denial unless it was obvious for it, but I had the denial of a dental cleaning and a chiropractic visit. Yeah, so yep, it's time to dump them and tell me to say, come home. Thomas Norman, N-O-R-M-A-N, May 21st, 1952, Medicare Advantage, right. We can take a quick look, but I was quite happy with the plan I had. Is there anything from your background and experience that would improve on what I had? Okay. Okay. How about we stick with that one? Yeah. J.T. Love Rear, he's a PA, but I believe his attending is, is it Maldonado, Carl, Carl, I forget the rest, how to spell the rest of his name. He's a PA. The practice is on Cain Creek, Cain Creek Road in, I believe it's Fairview, could be Fletcher. It's right in the border. Yes. Yes. I believe it's, let me hold on, what I'm going to do is, I will also search the all-knowing Dr. Google. Cain Creek Road, come on, come on, come on, family health. I'm finding lots of things for them. Okay. Here we go. May Act Family Health Center at Cain Creek. The doctor's name, oh, come on. They don't have lists of providers. Oh, wait, meet our providers. Okay. Form D. Okay. C-O-L-A-D-O-N-A-T-O. Call it Maldonado. C-O-L-A-N-D-O-N-A-T-O. Correct. Not finding him? Yes. Yeah. All right. Okay. Well, another provider at that site is Gilmer, C-I-L-M-E-R, Benjamin. Okay, good.

Yeah, it's Dr. M. Steven Saunders. Who knows. I'm pretty sure he does. M. Steven Saunders. No, no. What about your, would it come up by phone number? Yes. Yeah. Huh. So I was just there a couple of weeks ago. Yeah. Well, they took it, but then they declined the visit. But I know that they took all the information in two years of using Steve. Steve, if it's never been declined, never had an issue. I prefer staying with Steve, but he's quite good. All right. Okay. Sure. Hold on. I've got to grab a pen. Luckily, I packed several. Today, so I'm going to get some writing. Yeah. Okay. So your number? Eight, four, four, nine, eight, one. Okay. And Elizabeth. Okay. Yeah. No, generally, they don't do it. She normally answers the phone right away. Okay. Oh, you did. Huh. Now, what was, this is Tom Norman. What was the program which, when I was with well care, who wasn't you filed all my charges with? Well, but not the last. All the visits last year involved. Okay. Okay. Great. Thanks. Okay. Good. I'm afraid I don't have that with me. All right.
