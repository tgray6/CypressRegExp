Agent-Channel 1(RIGHT):  Thank you for calling well care Medicare. This call will be recorded for quality and training purposes. My name is Iman. How can I assist you today? Oh my goodness. Okay, let me see. And so I can help you with that. Do you have the power of attorney for your husband? Okay, let me see. Well, no, that's okay. I won't need information. We need to take a look at his coverage and see. Let me see something. And who is the plant? What what is the name of the plan he's on with us? The PPO. Okay, no, that's fine. And matter of fact, since you're handling this forum, grow ahead and grab them so I can just get his permission to open the file and me and you can look at everything. Hi, Jerry. How are you? Hi, how are you? I'm hanging in there. My name is Iman Anderson. I'm with well care Medicare. I am a licensed insurance agent and the call will be recorded for quality and training purposes. Jerry, I just wanted to get your permission that me and the misses can continue on and look in your file and she can answer for you. All right. Well, I thank you so much. All right, you too. Okay. Well, what I, well, that's exactly what I'm going to do. Oh, go ahead. That's okay. That's okay. What I'm going to do is now that I've got his permission on. I can actually pull everything with you because you'll be answering as if you were him. Okay. And so it is my job to assist in making sure your benefits meet your needs. Please know, we do not offer every plan available in your area. So let's get some of the basic out the way so I can pull the plan. And I'll explain what that donut hole is as well. Okay. Could you confirm the zip code and the county? You all are it. All right. Let's see what we got. Okay. Found that. And so let me have his first and last name on if you don't mind. Thank you, Mr. and his date of birth for me. Yes, I am from for originally I'm from Fort Walton Beach, Florida. But it's funny that you ask because we have roots in Saluda, South Carolina. And I'm going to I'm going to send one past you. My dad is from Maryland. So I think what it is and a lot of people say that to Mr. I think what it is, even though they raised us in Florida, having that and I'm sure you can agree with Austin Jersey, having that. Just that dialect in the household, I think I just picked up a lot of things. My dad's way, my dad's way worse though, Mr. I'm, you know, instead of brother, he says brother, mother, he says mother, you know, mother, I say mother, father. When I say New York, I think that's normally the giveaway because I say it like, because I'm from the South. So I say York. But if you're talking to my dad, he'll say New York, like no are in it. And I'm just, so it's funny. You pick it up. But yeah, I'm kind of all over a military breath. So let me see. Yeah, you must have it in the family if you can hear it. The good thing is with me being licensed upstate, a lot of agents don't like to talk to the people upstate, because you know, they tend to be rude from what we're used to in the South. And I'm a crybaby, Mr. Um, but I guess because I kind of sound like them. They don't give me a hard time. So until I go to pronounce in their cities and they're like, wait a minute, where are you from? Like yeah, I'm from the South. I don't know where this is. But we'll get a look at it. The donut hole, what that is while I'm pulling information to kind of give you an idea, because it's the easiest way to explain with the donut hole, the way they do it. We're going to use last year, for example, because we just started this year. For him to be that high starting off, something's up. So that's why I need to look at the plan. Normally you don't pay those type of co-pays until you're later on in the year. What the donut hole is. One, you hit that max, right? And that's right. Once you get, like when he was paying the $20 in the beginning of the year, that money is going towards that level they're looking at. This year, it's $5,000. So what they go with what you pay and the company pays. Once it reaches a certain amount, you enter the donut hole. That's where you pay the most of the money at until you come out. So it should have. Did you guys switch plans in January or did they switch his plan? It sounds like they got a deductible on them, Mr. Um, to be honest. I'm going to pull it. But it sounds that's the only thing that would make sense is that they didn't make you guys aware of a deductible that would had to be met in the beginning of the year. And that could be doing it. So let me pull this up. Because last year, if you didn't have a deductible, you would start right out paying whatever the co-pay was. But if you've got to be, they update these plans. So I know every year you know when they're calling you guys a thousand times, like hey, review, review, review, always review it because of things like that. Like you may get better dental, you may get a lower co-pay, but then if they neglect to tell you about a deductible. And now here we are with something like this when I'm sure that's something that you guys would have wanted to know. Let me find it. No, no. So because of the deductible may only be 200 or 300. Which is different from, you know, the however much the medicine is because he's not going to pay that amount since he has insurance. But if there's a deductible on that, then they'll have him meeting that deductible. He won't have to meet the whole thing, but they'll be a little by little along with the medication until it's met. So, but I will pull it up and then I can look at and take exactly what it is. And in case we're disconnected on, can you confirm the phone number for me? We've got that. One of the things that I do have to, well, let's go ahead and get his Medicare number in first. Do we have your permission to access Medicare systems to check his eligibility? And if you look at the red, white and blue Medicare card because that will pull the well care plan he has with us, I just need his letters and numbers. Oh no, the his red, white and blue. Let me see. This is the card you first get. When you first come on Medicare, it's like the paper card looking kind of it's made out of the same paper our socials are on. If not, no worries. I can pull them the old fashioned way. Yes, always keep it. We can, well, it's free to get another one. I can pull them the old fashioned way, Mr. But in future, whenever you guys get that card, just put it up because a lot of times you don't need it once you get well care. But the reason I say to keep it, huh, is because true, but always keep it like, you know, maybe with your important info, keep it because that is the only number that will not change for the entire time you're on. I can't really, no, I can pull it on. No worries. Let's see. 22, 19, 65. And his social, could you confirm his social for me? And I'll pull the Medicare number. You guys have been married for a while. You know everything. I mean, I know and not just married for a while, but you guys are close. And the reason I say that is because I've talked to members who have been married, you know for it, but they don't, they're like, hold on. Let me get it. But you're like, yes, this. I got that. Oh, man, they don't make them like they used to. They don't make them like you anymore. Shall I say? Let me see. And the way the kids are going, if it's not in their phones, we won't have it. So now, oh, man, well, I do see, I found them. I've got the address. Is, are you guys still on voice? So yeah, there's, we know there won't be a mailing issue. Now, this could be it. The plan he's got is the HMO, Mr. and it looks like he's basically with the PPO. That means you've got in and out of network service with an HMO. They typically want you to stay in network, which is fine. That's not going to be his issue. Something I do notice that we do need to look at. This is a plan from 2020, Mr. So they've done a lot of updating since then. I'm going to just be honest. So the medicine and question. What medication is it? Let me start there. Oh, yeah, and Tresto should be a tier three. Let me see. Yeah, and it does matter with you guys because I see he doesn't have any extra help. So we definitely need to figure out what's going on here. Or that whole amount would be on you guys. Let me see. 120. Let me pull this plan. One of the things since we are going to look at benefits now that I see what I'm looking at. That way I could just knock this out the way in case we have to do any updating. Medicare does require that I play a recorded disclaimer. Now, I'm not going to put any elevator music on you, Mr. Ron. It's only 90 seconds. It's basically just letting you know, hey, we're about to open the file and look and compare different benefits for description drugs and just take a whole look at it to see what's going on. So once that's over, we'll come right back to it. Hold on. Then you guys don't have to listen to this for 90 days. So hold on. Here we go. And I'm still here. January 30, 2024.

All right, and I did find it, but let me say this. Do you understand that? Thank you for your patience. Do you understand and agree to the disclaimer I played receiving calls and texts to this number? And let me get back down here. Now while the recording was playing, I did search for the information about the benefits we talked about. I do see they do have a deductible on them. That's what's doing it. It's actually a, let me pull the what he had before. Let me see. Because it's the same plan. It's just been rolled over, basically, from year to year. And you see if I can find the 2023 one for us. 20, okay, here we go. All right, I found it. Let's see what it says. 2023. That's what it was. It used to, they're used to, not, you used to didn't have a deductible on the medical. And get down here to the drug coverage. Yeah, I'm not saying. Yep, that's what it was. There was no deductible on it at first. Last year there was no deductible on it. And then when we got to this year, because I'm reading this plan has no deductible for part D coverage drugs. This year, the deductible on this same plan, same plan ID is $125. That's going to run neck to neck because that, and it's only on tears three to five. That's where that came from. No, because he's, once the deduct, well, once the deductible is met, well, how often does he fill the interest out? How much did they make you pay today? Mine is 92. So you've paid $82 into the deductible. So 125, because you said the medicine is originally $90, right? Oh, switch cheaper than that. Yeah, then it's cheaper than that, then. So that's what it is. You guys paid someone that deductible today. That's what happened. Nope, they, they put a deductible on here. Now, I'm trying to see if we have anything without a deduct, deductible on it, but let's see. Okay. Okay. That's what all it was. Right. And that's all it. When looking at it, since you did pay, let me put the entresto in first. And let me see how much it is this year for it. What's the dosage on that? You take your time. That'll give me time to figure out where I'm going with this. What? 24. Let me see. And what pharmacy are you using, hun? To fill it. Okay. Let me find it. I see it on rice avenue. Okay. Let's see. Pear. Yes. And entresto. Okay. I see the 24. How often do they want them to take it? Okay. Add. And let's see what this does. Yeah. Because the pharmacy is in network. So we know it's not that. That's a blessing there. Get back. Assist. With value. Okay. Compare. And to your five benefits evidence of coverage. Premium. No premium. Premium. Jogs monthly breakdown. Okay. So. Yep. That's what it is. So January. It's got a. It was actually $11.03. Plus that deductible. It looks like they're going to charge it. Every until December actually. Let me see. Estimated costs $132. Let me see this one. No premium. Does he see specialist? Is he paying $45 when he sees a specialist? Premium value. Yeah. It's got a $45 copay. Now. And entresto is only $11.03. So you guys actually have an option for him. Because there's a well care. It was updated. There's a well care no premium value. It's. It's got an extra name other than the well care premium. And let me stand these side by side. Let me see what the difference is. The one that I'm looking at the updated one. It doesn't have a deductible. How he is eligible to update it. So this would take it. It would take effect February 1st. So that would get us out of meeting that deductible. Only looking at that $11 copay. If the rest of his drugs are $0 copays with us with well care. That shouldn't change. I mean, I'd still put him through just to make sure. Specialist would still be a. Okay. So those. So they should stay $0 copays for him then. And then. So yeah, that's it. Essentially up to you. He can get out of that deductible. Because this one that. So I'm looking at. Let's see. Let me make sure. Let me look at the hospital. Things like that. Will he be doing anything with his dental. This year. Okay. So that's a good thing because on the updated one. You know, now if he needed dentures still then I would say, yeah, let's stay put. But he's got dental, but it's like for fluoride treatments. If he's not going to be using it, then we're good there. Let me take a look at hospital. Let me. But the hospital copay is. Inpatient. Oh, well, he saves money on the hospital to on the updated right now. You guys, if he were to be admitted, we're looking at a $400 copay per day. Days one through five. On the one I'm looking at. It's $372 copay per day. So save a little bit of money there. One through five. You see what about his vision? Does he wear glasses? Okay. I'm like he's blind, then. Look, I'm like he's blind now. I'm glad you got that. I'm like, wait a minute. Well, he can't see now. I made it worse. We're going to tell somebody, but no. Okay. Well, he's still. If he did need readers, for instance, that's still on there. I see he doesn't have over the counter. So he would gain over the counter card as well. They took that out on this one. Yeah. But now with the one that's well care. I can get it done. It's called a well care. No. It's the same name, but it's well care. No premium value. So the hospital sheep are you on the same one? Oh, gotcha. Oh, you're still a baby like me. Yeah, he is too. We are all the same age. So I was about to say I'm like, I'm going to stop saying, ma'am, you're my age. But I am looking at it. The one difference I do see. It does take half as he see his main doctor, his PCP. Now that that as long as he's taking his medicine, that's the only difference I see. Now, if he needed emergency trip. Right now he's at 120, but on the updated one, it's 100 for emergency care. He still has hearing services. Now, the only difference because they do have a small difference. I knew I'd find something somewhere. The doctor right now, he's got a zero dollar copay. Would a five dollar copay be too much for the main doctor? Because this is a zero, this is a zero dollar premium plan. So he's not going to pay to keep it in place, just like the well care. No premium. He's on now. So we'll let me grab this one and grab his meds for me. Even though we know they should all be zero. I'm going to run him through just so we have no surprises. But the next time before you don't are you guys on the way home dinner? Oh, okay. So let's see. Is it 531 where you guys are? 630. So I don't get off until it's 530 my time, but I don't get off until eight o'clock tonight. Those medicines I know will need though. Now we still have time. What is you guys scheduled tomorrow? We can set it up for tomorrow. Yeah, we can we can set it up for tomorrow and the good. And have it right. Will he be there as well? Because what we'll do, they've done a difference. So it's not you guys are on the phone forever. Once we put the meds in, put the doctor in and everything looks good. I'll do the rating and I'll actually send you a text so that way you can help him. And that way you could see everything we did too. And we'll do it that way to finish the enrollment. So what's a good time for you tomorrow? I don't I get to work at. 1230 your time. Because I work late. Okay. Well, I'll make you guys my first call up the morning then or of the afternoon. So when I get in, I'll give you a ring. 1230. Well, 1230 your time. Right. I get in at 1130. So what I'll do is I'll go ahead and save this. And we'll pick up where we left off. And I'll work a little bit on it to get some of the straggling out the way. And we'll get it done. Oh, not a problem. I'll talk to you guys tomorrow and eat enough for me. Oh, grab my number. Mr. I'm I'm sorry. Grab that. So you'll have it. Okay. So it's my name is Miss Anderson. And my numbers eight four four nine eight one one four zero seven. Uh-huh. And then my extension is two eight six eight. You got it. All right. That way if you miss me. Yeah. If you miss me, Mr. You could just call me back directly. But I'll call you first thing in the morning. And we'll get it situated. You're welcome on. Bye. Bye. Bye.

Customer-Channel 0(LEFT):  I'm actually calling about my husband's medicine, he used to pay $20 for it, then it went up to $90 because they said we were in the donut hole, whatever that means. And that was $172, I don't know, I'm just calling because I just went picked up as medicine and he said it would be $90 and it's $172, he's here if you need to speak to him. I don't know, Jay, give me your well care card, it's a PPO, that's all I know, I'm sorry, PPO, okay, here are you. Hello? How are you doing? I'm very good. Yes, ma'am. Most definitely, yes. It's nice to hear. I haven't called it here, but it's actually last year. Well, they don't have any idea where his new card is. I think we probably, I think we thrown it in the trash accidentally or something, not realizing it was the card, you know, the mail. Okay. Union counties that coach 29379, Jerry, J-E-R-R-Y Durham, D-U-R-H-A-M, 222.65. May I ask where you're from? I'm reading my asses because my mother is from New Jersey and you sound just like my aunt who is also from New Jersey. I feel like I'm... Oh, okay. Yeah, you definitely did. Yeah. Yeah, New York. Yeah. Yeah, well, that's why I was confused because the first part of the year it was 20 and then the pharmacist explained it a little bit like there's a maximum of how much you all pay. And then, yeah. Yeah, well, I said it went up to 90, but I figured it would start over in January. I think it was $172. No. No. I mean, why would that be different from last year? But I mean, but why would he have a deductible this year? Oh, okay. Yeah. Well, the medicine, the actual medicine is like almost $2,000. So wouldn't he have to pay that whole 2,000 if they had him in the deductible? Oh, I see. Yeah. 864-425-381-5. Yes. Okay. We don't have one of those. No, I don't think was ever had one except for the thing. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, probably don't. I didn't know. Do you have that original red, white, blue Medicare card? I didn't know we were supposed to keep it. Well, kind of they were there. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, that's what we figured once he switched the whale care, we didn't need that one anymore. So well. Yeah, that's what I'm looking at now on my papers, but I don't see it. We probably just threw the way. Okay. 225-045-4873. You guys been very full of water. Yeah, 28 years. Oh, I know mine has both our children. That's why I know it because they'll call me for it. Yes. I don't know what that means. Oh, yeah. I think. Interesto. Okay. Yes. Yes. Is that new? Yeah. Okay. So that means it's not going to be any remarks over 30 days. 172. Well, it was the co-pay for it was 91. We were in the donut hole, but it started out as Quentin. Okay. All right. Well, I really was just concerned the pharmacists had made a mistake. Um, but okay. Well, that's the, you know, the risk of his medicine is zero. You know, I'm saying, so I don't mind paying the deductible. It's that's all it is. I just was going to wanted to make sure that the pharmacist had, you know, put the information in right and all that. Okay. Um, oh, what's the matter from there? Give it to me. Hurry. 24, 24 or 26. It's a union family pharmacy. It's a locally owned pharmacy here. I think it's one of the day. Yeah. So once we get the deductible met, it won't be bad. Right. The cardiologist yet. Actually, I'm not sure what he pays because he hasn't been yet. He goes next month. Mm-hmm. Uh-huh. Well, they're all generic too. All of those are generic. I've looked them up and even, even if I just get them at Walmart, we're no insurance. They're 10 to a month, you know, so yeah. Well, everything else pretty much the same. Uh, no, he has dentures, so he don't need them. Yeah. No. No, he had cataract surgery. So he got eyes like a bat. I mean, like a, like an eagle. You see everything. He was like a bat. Now he's an eagle. No, he was blind as a bat. Now it's like an eagle. Yeah. See, we had that last year too. And now that's gone. Yeah. So how do we switch to the one you're talking about? Okay. No, I'm not eligible. He's on disability. That's why he has. I'm only 49. He's only 50. Yeah. He's only 50. Not often, actually. He's actually really healthy now, but he's had his knee surgeries and stuff as far as, you know, other other things. Yeah. If he doesn't get sick much, we ever see that. No. Yeah. I don't have them. I don't have them with me. I'm an ex. No, man. I'm actually in the car. No, we're actually on a way to meet our son for dinner. Yeah. It is 630. Oh, anytime. I'm open. I own my own business, so I can call you. Okay. That's a great. That way I can get everything and have it all with me. Yes. Okay. I'm 1230. I can do it. So 1230. Yeah. Okay. All right. I appreciate you. Oh, all right. Listen. All right. I'm going to get my son to put it in his phone. That way I can put it in my heart. What is it? Uh-huh. 844. Okay. 981. 1407. That's it. 2868. Yeah. All right. Well, I appreciate it. All right. Thank you, ma'am. Bye-bye. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
