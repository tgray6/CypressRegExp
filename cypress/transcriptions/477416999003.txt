That's a very popular medication. And how often do you take that? Okay. And what else? Oh, okay. That makes it easy. All right. Well, all your medications are going to be zero dollars. So that's great. But I'm sure that's what you're used to. Yep. That's that's always great. So let's see. All right. So we got that taken care of. Now let me tell you about this plan here. I think you're going to love it. I'm just pulling up the summary benefits. Let's see. F B D. Okay. All right. So this is going to be a fantastic plan for you. Let me just tell you about it. So to start with the good stuff. So this plan here, it's going to give you a spendables card. It's like a debit card. You would have this in the mail within a week. And what's nice about it is it's preloaded at the beginning of the month. And anything that you don't use out of that $210, it's going to roll over to the following month. And it's a grand total of $2,520. And with this, you can get over the counter item. So basically anything you want to get at the pharmacy, you can use it for dental vision and hearing if you elect to. You can use it to buy food with it. So that's always nice. And then you can swipe it right at the gas pump. If you want to get gas in a vehicle, it doesn't have to be your car. It could be anybody's car you want. But you can just swipe it like you would a credit card. Also, you can use this for utility assistance. It's great because you can use it for your internet. You can use it for your cell phone bill if you want to. You can use it for your natural gas, electricity, trash, cable, TV service. Only thing you can't use it for is like a streaming service like Netflix, for example, but anything else you can use it for. And then you can also pay rent with it. I don't know if you have to pay rent, but you could use it for rent, too. So how does that sound? Sound good? Okay. Well, let me tell you about this plan here. It's called the WellCare Dual Liberty. And I'm going to reach everything that pertains to money. Well, everything's actually going to be $0. So that makes it easy. But I think one second here. All right. So monthly plan premium is $0. There is no deductible. The max out of pocket. Most you could possibly pay with this plan is $8,850. Inpatient hospital, outpatient hospital, $0. ambulatory surgical center, $0. So any type of surgery that you get at the hospital, $0. Doctors, primary care specialists, all $0. Annual wellness visit, bone mass measurement, breast cancer screening, cardiovascular screening, vaccines, all that stuff, $0. $0. ER and urgent care here in the United States is $0. Now, if you were to travel outside of the country, and you go to the ER or urgent care, that's the only thing that you could possibly pay for. That's going to be $100 with a maximum of $50,000 worth of coverage. And then, let's see here.
