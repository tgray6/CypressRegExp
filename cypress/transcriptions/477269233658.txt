Agent-Channel 1(RIGHT):  Thank you for calling a well care medic care. My name is Chris McNally, I'm a licensed agent. Good to have the pleasure of speaking with you. I can take a look what's the date of birth again. All right. And with Medicare parts, A and B, right? Thank you. Thank you. Hey, go birdie. How are you doing today, sir? Good. My name is Chris. I'll be able to help you out today. So what can I do for you? Was there certain benefits you're looking for? Do you have any questions for me? Yeah. Because they do have a lot of different benefits this year. So you never chip, you never did you, you go ahead. Okay. Just 150. So I can see if I can try to find you something higher than that with that bear, right? Yeah. No, no, definitely. Everybody, everybody needs some help, you know, in this time, even I do. Yeah. I'm not going to lie. Man, they, they, they, they tried to pack on 600 hours extra rent in the beginning of the year. And it just was just one year. And they're making it too hard to live now. I'd rather live in my car and use Wi-Fi like McDonald's, exactly. So, so yeah, how much did you say you get actually? 150. Okay. And you said that's with United Health Care over low, you know, I mean, I can get you up to 165. And it can, and it could be used for other things too. So it's like a Visa card. So you, you could use it for like utilities, assistance, rent, you know, gas if you want to pay at the pump over the counter medication and food. Yeah. Yeah. It's a little bit easier. So that's, it's under the well care dual liberty nurture plan. So it's a, it's just like United Health Care. It's a different company. But you have the same, you have the same benefits as far as medical. So everything medical would be zero. And the only difference is that you're, you're a well care card. They'll send you. We'll have a higher benefit on that. And of course, you can use it for other things. It doesn't have to be just for food. So we can get you into that one for February 1st. All right. Let's go ahead and pull this up here. Oh, right. Gilberto. Followers and Gilberto. Oh, definitely. Is it cold over there too? Oh, God. So God. So yeah, I don't either. I'm Florida born and raised. So cold is not, not, not for me. Oh, yeah. Oh, nice. Yeah. I'm in, I'm in Lakeland. Yeah. Right around. Yeah. No, no, the bucks again. They get up there, man. He's the root of it. You grew the football. So good, brother. So let me flip your information here. What's your social? Okay. Well, either you, if you know your social or your Medicare number, either one of those. Okay. Okay. All right, Gilberto. No, no problem at all. That's why that's why we give, that's why I get paid to do this, to do all this work for you. So oh, Chuck, I'm terrible when it comes to like math and my numbers, like a numbers thing, but I like, I'm more of a, you know, history and science. You know, I wanted, I wanted to design, I wanted to design video games or make video games at one time, and you need a lot of math for that. So I couldn't do it. Oh, yeah. I mean, I could use hope on my car too. I got a Ford tourist thing, have an issues with. Well, just, just after Mark, your headlight for some reason will not, about the same one and it will not go on. It's one of those N-tex. You put the ballast on. Yeah. That's what I'm thinking because for some reason, the, you know, I'm pretty sure, you know, I'm sport enough to look on YouTube and you know, change the wires. It's just a couple of wires, but some reason it won't come back on. I don't know. Yeah, I've become a YouTube, YouTube mechanic. Oh, yeah. Yeah, it's tough for me because I, you know, I'll try it a couple of times and I'm like, man, it's just a light bulb. I can't, just a light bulb to work. Yeah. Put my mind into it like I do healthcare. All right. So I'm just going to check your Medicaid status. I'm in, I'm still in Florida as of right now. I plan to leave too soon. So I've been, I've been here in Florida so long now. It's just, I guess I've had enough. Maybe, maybe, maybe a change of scenery, you know, might help. So it'll be the healthcare tool access. A little special needs plan. And then we can get you effective February 1st. What pharmacy do you like to use most of the time? If you, if you go to a pharmacy, AGV? Okay. All right. And you've got Medicare and June 1st of 2008. Okay. And are you still working as of right now? Okay. Yeah. You just kind of oversee it now a little bit. Oh, yeah. It's all you have definitely. I don't want to hurt yourself. Because then you got to use the insurance. Oh, boy. Yeah, exactly. All right. So I just want to ask Gilberto, do you have a primary care doctor right now that you see? Okay. So you don't really have a doctor. Okay. Well, what I could do is, in the mean time for the application, I can get you a doctor, put it on there, but I can send you out a list of doctors. And then you can choose from there who you want to see. Is that okay? Okay. Yeah. Because I know some people that some people like to check out this dentist as well. Yeah. Yeah. So yeah. Well, care does cover all that dentistry for you. So they do comprehensive as well. No. I mean, it's good. Because mine, man, I'm going to probably have to lose all mine by 40. I ate a lot of candy when I was a kid. Too much candy. Way too much candy. Oh, that's good. Yeah. Yeah. To be honest, with you, because look, you came back and it bites me in the butt now. Yeah. I'm going to see up Saturday morning cartoons and everything. Okay. Let me see. All right. Just bear with me once I can hear. So it'll be the dual access harmony. All right. And then Gilberto, I just want to go over just prescriptions with you. Are you currently taking any prescriptions or now right now? Okay. Okay. You know, that's good. At least you're healthy. You know, I've had I do this a lot and let me tell you this. I have people normally every day with 10 to 15 plus prescriptions. Yep. Crazy. Or two times a day, three times a day. That must be tough. Yeah. I'm the same way. I just like to deal with it. And I'm like, I don't need to go. That'll be better later. That's what I say all the time. Is he like, no, you, you got to take care of your mom. I'm like, I'll be fine. I will lay it. Yeah. We'll see. We'll see if we look. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. If that's what the law wants, I'm going to amen. All right. So I just have a doctor in this Kristen White in the area, but doesn't mean you have to see her. It's just I just have to put around the application. Okay. So I'll send you out a list of doctors that you could choose from as well. Now, we do have a faster way of actually doing this. Do you have a smartphone by any chance? Good, bro. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. No problem. So okay. Well, no problem. If you're fine with doing this over the phone, then we could just do that here. Okay. All right. Go, bro. So we'll go ahead and I'll start running this application here for you this way. I can at least get your cards out to you and we'll have everything ready by the first of February. All right. Go, bro. Just go ahead and verify the spelling of your first and last name. All right. Perfect. And then can you just verify from me right now? You're saying you don't take any prescriptions. You're not prescribed anything. Okay. Perfect. So let's go ahead and continue. So now before we make that a room decision, I just want you to fully understand the plans, benefits and rules here. So based on what we discussed, just confirm you're enrolling into the well care. It's the dual access harmony. Dual special needs plan. Now the effective date is step. You were refers to 2024. The plan premium is zero dollars. Is that correct? Okay. What's the good phone number? Yeah. Good phone number. Okay. Perfect. All right. And then just verify the county residents and street address. 4945. What's that again? 4945 E 70 street. This avenue. And is that in Brownsville? Okay. All right. And so these next two questions are mandatory for me to ask optional for you to answer. Are you of Hispanic, Latino or Spanish origin? Okay. Okay. No problem there. And do you want your plan information in English? Okay. All right. So I'm going to go ahead and play. Oh wait. Let me get your Medicaid number. Since you do have Medicaid. All right. So I'm going to go ahead and play about a three minute recording directly from Medicare. Now right after that, we'll go ahead and finish this up here. Okay. Well care is a licensed and certified representative of Medicare Advantage HMO, HMO SNP, PPO, PPO SNP and VFFS organizations and stand alone PDP prescription drug plans. Each of the organizations there represent has a Medicare contract. Enrollment in any plan depends on contract renewal. Non-contracted out of network providers are not obligated to treat you except for emergencies are urgently needed services. Otherwise, you may be responsible for the cost. Your ability to enroll in the special needs plan is based on verification that you are entitled to both Medicare and the qualifying level of Medicaid. The information on this enrollment form is correct to the best of my knowledge. I understand that if I am getting assistance from a sales agent, broker or other individual employed buyer contracted with well care, he or she may be paid based on my enrollment in well care. Well care serves a specific service area. If I move out of the area that well care serves, I need to notify the plan so I can disenroll and find a new plan in my new area. Once I am a member of well care, I have the right to appeal plan decisions about payment or services if I disagree. I understand that my verbal signature or the verbal signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of the individual under the laws of the state where the individual resides on this application means that I have read and understand the contents of this application. If signed by an authorized individual, this verbal signature certifies that, one, this person is authorized under state law to complete this enrollment, and two, documentation of this authority is available upon request by Medicare. All right, so Governor, we are all good there, so we have you here under the well care dual access harmony. That's all good. So just confirming that we are on the well care no monthly premium zero dollars, and it's going to be starting February 1st, is that correct? All right, so we're all good there. Now do you have a pen and paper I can give you your confirmation number? All right. All right, so it's going to be H's and Harry, P as in Paul, P as in Tom, 105, 2837. All right, and let me give you down my number here, just in case. So going forward, if you have any questions, concerns, anything with your Medicare Medicaid, you can just give me a call, okay? So it's going to be 844-981-1407. Yes, sir, and my name is Chris. Yes, sir, my pleasure, Gilberto. So I appreciate you calling in, at least we can get you some additional help. And yeah, that card, you know, now you can use it for other starting February 1st, you can use it. So in the meantime, just use your United for the rest of the way, okay? So for this month, you're still just going to use United and get those two cards sent over to you with your well care and your visa spendables card, along with that booklet. So you'll have all your provider information, dentists, doctor information, all that. All right, so yeah, everything looks all good there. Let me just double and triple check. Yeah, so we're all good there, Gilberto. So I have any questions for me, sir? All right, perfect. All right, Gilberto, I appreciate it, man. And if you stay safe over there, okay? Have a good one. Thank you. Bye-bye. Bye, Gilberto.

Oh, boy. No, I think it was a car and stuff mechanic. So I've really been. Clicked up my letters and stuff. Oh, yeah. Oh, she might have not ground or something on it. It's got to have a good ground on the metal. Yeah. Oh, yeah. YouTube helps a lot now. I mean, when I get stuck, I get in there and it helps me out a lot. Yeah. You can step by step. Yeah. It's good now. It's a half YouTube, but just to show you step by step all the way. You're just going to have patience and be. Let's get out of it. We shall have a lot of patience. I guess that's why I do mechanic. People don't have patience. They're doing it. Yeah. Sometimes you gotta like really set your mind on it and focus and until you get it. Eventually, you'll be getting it. Yeah, yeah. And you'll be able to get it. Where are you at? Oh, still photo. Oh, okay. Where are you heading? Oh, boy. You're really going to the cold.

Now my mom's gave us candy at our heart. We didn't really. Plus because we were kind of low income. So we didn't have much to be going and getting. They were just focused on getting food and stuff for the house. And so I guess that was a good thing. I went to a lot of milk when we were small. Even we're five years old. We're still making a bottle of food. I'm thinking it's in the cash card too. And five years old. And they'll be like, we don't have the teeth, but I don't think it's true because I mean, we've stayed the longest time drinking milk and our teeth are fine. We go kid.
