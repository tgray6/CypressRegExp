You are under no obligation to enroll, but I will need your consent to the statements before proceeding with the planned presentation. It is important.

Please note that during this validation CMS may provide additional details regarding your eligibility, which could assist me in finding a plan that best fits your needs. Okay, can you verify your address? Thank you. And I see here that your primary care doctor is a Dr. Jerry Heady. Okay, and are you seeing any other specialty doctors? Okay, and are you taking any medications? Let me see. Now did you speak to Richard about your medications? Okay, now Miss Catherine, do you happen to have a list of your medications with you? Okay, let me see. Okay. Okay, so you have an all-beer all. And do you know how many milligrams your progesterone is? No. Okay. Okay, and how often do you take that a day? Okay. Once a day, okay. You know how many milligrams your estrogenol is? No. Okay. Okay. And is that a tablet patch or gel? Tablet, okay. And is that once a day as well? Yeah, okay. And you said you take a narco as well. All right, let me see. And is that also once a day or do you take a couple a day? Two a day. Okay. Okay. Okay. Ad bear. And do you usually get one of those inhaler a month? Alrighty. And what pharmacy do you go to? Okay. All right. Let me see here. And do you know if you receive a Medicaid VA or try care? Okay. All right. Let me take a look here. Now when it comes with two plan options, do you like HMOs or PPOs? Okay. So an HMO plan has like a network of doctors and then PPO plans. You could see doctors outside of the network. Mm-hmm. Okay. All right. Mm-hmm. Yeah. So Dr. Jerry Hetty is in the network. I just want to make sure that I can give you the most benefits and a plan that he accepts. You're so welcome. Are you working right now? I see here that you nannies were for a four-year-old. No. Oh, okay. Right. No, you're okay. Let me see here. Oh, my name is Victoria. You're welcome. No, are you a home health aid? No, are you just... Okay. You do independent work. Yeah. Good. Okay. And then I do need to make sure that you have an enrollment period here. OEP. Okay. Perfect. All right. So there is a plan option here. It's called a well care, no premium HMO. It's $0 a month. And your Dr. Hetty is in the network here. So that's good. You're welcome. I am seeing that all of your medications will be covered. But how much are you paying for your ad fare right now a month? It changes. Okay. Right. Okay. Okay. I do see that here. And do you know if you get extra help with your medications through the state of Indiana? Okay. You're welcome. Thank you. Okay. Let me see. Okay. Okay. I live in Indiana as well. So I know all about that. I hope stuff. I am unfortunately. Right. Oh, yes. Yeah. Oh, they've definitely gone downhill. Right. You're okay. Oh, no. Right. Right. Oh, absolutely. Okay. So I do see here that you do have that extra help for your medications. All right. So the, like I said, this plan is $0. The maximum out of pocket for the year is $3,900. Again, your doctor is in the network and all of your medications will be covered. So the $3,900 is the most that you'll have to pay in co-pays or co insurance before everything becomes $0 for you. Yeah. Now, are you fairly healthy? Okay. Good. So you'll probably never reach that number there. Let me see here. I'm just taking a few notes so we can go ahead and get you signed up. You're so welcome. Thank you. Oh, thank you. It's not, it's not very common anymore. And in case of emergencies, is there a hospital that you like to go to? Okay. Okay. At what time do you get off work today? Oh, my goodness. Yes. You are very busy. Okay. So I do have to go through your medications with you. So your albedoal and progesterone, RIT or two medication. The estridol is a tier one. Your narco is a tier four and then your ad bear is a tier three. So it looks like your ad bear will be $11.20. Your narco will be $4.50. The estridol will be $0.00 and then the albedoal and the progesterone will also be $4.50. You'll receive $1,500 in dental to see Dr. Heady would be $0 and then any specialist would be $35. Yeah. So for the eye care, it does cover up to $200 towards glasses, lenses, and frames. And then your eye exams will be $0.00. And then with this plan option, you will also be receiving $60 every month on and over the counter spending card. So you can use that towards like toiletries for your home as well as vitamins and over the counter medications. You're welcome. I do. I live in Carmel. It's a. Oh, okay. How was it? I was I wasn't able to go this year. Good. Oh. Oh, I love that. I love that. Okay. So Miss Catherine, unfortunately, I do have to read through quite a bit of information here. I will try to be as quick as I can. Okay. So again, it's a well care no premium HMO. It is $0 and your maximum out of pocket is $3,900. For any inpatient hospital stay, days one through six will be $350 and day seven through 90 will be zero for any outpatient services. You're looking at $120. To see your primary care doctor will be zero to see any specialists would be $35. Preventative care such as your vaccines or annual visits will be $0. To go to the emergency room would be $120. And to go to the urgent care would be a $35. So to go to the emergency room would be a $35. That's a $15. Thinking about it, building a patient and replacing them would be a $10. For example, you actually have a $1. And you can think of it as a $25. For example, to the patient, because you have a $250. If you're an expert, then you're looking at a $9200. that would be a $0 copay. Any hearing aid fittings will be a $0 copay, and then you'll receive a $1000 per year to be used towards hearing aids. Anything to do with your preventative dental will be a $0 copay. Any more comprehensive dental work would be a $35 copay. And then if you need like dentures, extractions, or any restorative services on your dental, that would be a 40% co-insurance. For the eye exam, like I said, that would be $0, and then it'll be a $0 copay for any eye wear, and you'll receive $200 to be used towards glasses. If you were ever admitted into a skilled nursing facility, days 1-20 would be $0, $21-40 would be $203, and $41-100 would be $0 again. For any physical therapy, outpatient rehab, or pulmonary rehab, that would be a $35 copay. If you were to ever need an ambulance, ground, or air, that would be a $285 copay. And then this plan does come with 36 rides of transportation. If you ever need a ride to inform your doctor, that would be covered for you at a $0 copay. And then this also covers chiropractic and acupuncture at a $20 copay. And then any like dermal medical equipment, prosthetics, that would be a 20% co-insurance, as well as a fitness benefit at a $0 copay as well. And then of course that $60 every month to be used on over the counter. Do you have any questions for me? Okay. Yeah, like I knew a red, white, and blue card. Yeah, I can definitely put in an order for you for that. Okay. I'm just taking a few notes and then we can go ahead and get you signed up. Now Ms. Katherine, is the phone that you're using a smartphone? Okay. Okay. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to fill out some information here on my end.
