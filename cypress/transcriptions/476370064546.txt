Okay, so you do have the Medicaid, so you do qualify. Do or select. Or it looks like you're right now you're part of the United Health Care dual-complete. Okay. Let's see. So, we do have a plan that can give you benefits, but this would change your other plan, okay? So, instead of United Health Care, you would have well-care. Is that okay? Is that hospital? I'm going to take a look just in a moment. So, this one that you do qualify for. Let's see. Yeah, you do qualify. I'm going to take a look. So, it has 70 dollars a month over the counter, dental vision, food, gas, utilities, rent. Let's see what else? A month, yes. Over the counter, food, rent, utilities, gas. It's for all of that. Two hundred dollars for glasses, and then it has two thousand for dental. So, if you need dentures, things like that, or extractions, comprehensive services, cleanings, it covers it for zero. Yes, you could cover it for the dentures. Okay, for zero. You just need to make sure you stay in the network. So, we can go ahead and look at your doctors and medications. Let's check your doctors, let's review your doctors and medications. What's the name of the doctor that you want to go to? One moment. How do you spell his name? Okay. Okay, looking it up right now. Okay. Okay. All right, so we do have the doctor. Let me see. And do you have any specialists? Okay, just the one doctor. Do you care if it's a PPO or an HMO? Do you prefer PPO? True. Yeah, okay. Okay. No, yeah, the one I told you about is a PPO. I was just making sure. Yeah, it's a PPO, the one I told you about. Okay. Yeah, we have to go over your medications. Yeah, we have to go over the medications. Let me just take a look here. Doctor. Yeah, I'm just collecting the information from the doctor. And then we'll go over the medications. No specialists. Also the hospital. I have to go over the hospital with you. Memorial. Which one? Medical hospital? What about medical center on top and niche? In top and niche. In 502 West 4th Avenue. Well, this is a one over by 502 West 4th Avenue. Is that the same address? Okay. But is that hospital okay? All right. Let me see. Memorial. It's in top and niche. Memorial hospital. Let me see. Multi-care. Over by Tilt and Drive. Tight and Drive. Okay, let's see. See if I can find it. Yeah, we have that one. Yakima Valley Memorial Hospital on 2811 Tight and Drive. That's fine. You can go to that one. Okay. And did you need it? You don't need another doctor or anything. Okay. Very good. Very good. So we do have the doctor in the hospital or in the network. So that's perfect. Okay. Let's see. What's the name of the clinic? Let's see. Farm workers. Is it a dead farm workers clinic or by 601 West Keys Road? Okay, one moment. It doesn't have a phone number. That's how I search for it usually. It's a little bit weird that it doesn't have a phone number. 510 West 4th Avenue. Oh, okay. It's for the dentist. Okay. Let's see. Okay. Let's see. We do have some people at that location. 510 West 4th Avenue. Yeah. Let's see. I have Jessica Aherne. I have Aaron Anderson at that location. And that's about it, actually. That's only those two. Is that his phone number two? 509 8655 600. Okay. So the only ones I see is Cheryl Crane. Kristen Deward. Ali Evans. Ahmed Nahan. Daniel Nicarod. Destiny Noel. Adrian Zavo. Janet Williams Cox. Jessica Aherne and Aaron Anderson. And that's it. Those are the only ones. Actually. Let me double check in here. Yes. Those are the doctors that accept Welker at that location. What's in your doctor? How do you spell that doctor's name? Can you spell the last name again? Is it Mary? It's Nancy. Oh, he has a long name. Last, Emil Joseph Marquez-Kalayan. That's him, right? It is a long name. Is the phone number the 509 8655 600? Let me try to see if he comes out with the name. And then I'll try with the number again. Well, I think I already tried with the number. Yes.

I don't see any Dennis. Yeah, I don't see Dennis at that location. I get, yeah, I guess they don't accept well care. Because I do see Dennis, but just not that with that location with that phone number. I have, let's see. I have a word by Yakima 2402 South 1st Street. How much are they going to charge you for the work? Yeah, this one would be $2,000. But the problem is that your insurance is still not, is only going to give you $500 for that. You're still going to have to pay out of pocket. Okay. Did you, what's up to you? Did you, what do you think you think you would be able to change to a different dental office and start the job again with higher dental coverage so they can pay for it? Oh, okay. Okay. And do you know if it's going to be a lot out of pocket, did they tell you? So this program is a PPO where you're able to go out of network and it would be 50% of the cost. Yes. Move where? Oh, to different insurance. Okay. Yes, I have them. Okay. Okay. You can call me. Yeah, let me get you. Let me give you my number. Okay. Let me know when you're ready. Okay.

The one in five, you know, first history in tapiness. Five, ten west, first avenue. Really? You don't see dentures in that location. But they have a dental. They have a dental clinic in that location. Nobody accepts both. What location do you have on the agenda? This is 20. Oh, that's going to be the problem now. Because they started my, they started doing my dental at the farm workers clinic in tapiness. And I have an appointment coming on February to finish the job that they started. So if they don't accept well care, then that will be a problem. I don't know yet. Because when 2023, I have a 5000 limit. But this 2024, if I stay on the same, if I stay on the same, or Medicare, the community helpers, I'm going to only have $500 limit. That's why I'm looking for a higher limit on dental. Because they haven't finished the job. Yeah, I know. That's why. But then the problem is they, you don't see any dentists that will do my, that they will do it on farm community health. I mean, in farm workers clinic in tapiness. But they, they already started the job 2023, but they haven't finished it yet. That's why I don't have teeth right now. That's why I'm looking for a better insurance that will finish the job without, you know, without bringing out any money out of my pocket. You know, what they, they're going to do now is just do an impression on my gum and then do the partial, partial dentures. That's all they have to do. So if I change again, then it will take time again. Because I've been with no teeth since November. No, they haven't told me yet. I went to the billing department today, but they said they will give me a call. I see. Can you, do you have a direct number Luis? I can call you back so I can talk to my husband because both of us are going to move. If I move, he will move. He will transfer. I mean, if we, if I move from community, yeah, and we move, they go to your place, to your well care from community health care to well care. Then let's, I will just call you back when he's home, because he's not home right now. Okay, you have the right. Okay. I'm ready. One, eight, four, four. One, four, zero, seven. Okay.
