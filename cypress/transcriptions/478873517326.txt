Agent-Channel 1(RIGHT):  Hello, and thank you for calling Wild Care Medicare. How can I help you? Oh, okay. Let's take a look into that. Do you have your Medicare card, your red-white and blue card? Okay. Can I look you up by your social, then? Okay. How do you spell your last name? That way I know I have it right. Okay. That's what I thought. And then your date of birth? 1962. Okay. Thank you. All right. And then are you still on West Main Street in Belleville? Okay. All right. Yeah. Well, I'm taking a look for you. What'd you say? Yeah. The only time that it wouldn't is... Or it would change it as if the plan sees to exist. And that's kind of seems like what happened. Is that... Well, let me see. Because you wanted to be on the advantage, right? Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I don't see... Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I can see that in here. Okay. We'll get you fixed, then. You want... Let me see. Let me add you... Well, it wasn't someone. It was that the plan you were on with us doesn't exist anymore. I don't know how they even kept you on that because that plan hasn't existed since 2016. So they should have fixed it then. But no one ever fixed it. And I think it finally caught up. That's all that happened. Yeah. I know. Trust me. I'm thinking the same way you are. I'm doing it right now for you. Yeah. No problem. It's one of those things where it's like they're supposed to send a letter and they didn't, hoping that you wouldn't notice. And it's not wild care that did that. It's Medicare and GenVol. They just... They do that. It is ridiculous. Trust me. I'm in the same boat as you about it. Okay. Do you have Medicaid? Hmm. Okay, yeah. I'll see if anything changed there too. And then that'll explain a little bit more. Hey, nothing could change on your side. But they changed the laws all the time. And then they boot people off the stuff or they add. They give them better coverage. I'm sure you know how all that is. Right. And no matter how much you think you know, it always changes. Yeah. Yeah. That's what I was saying. Mm-hmm. Yeah. It's ridiculous. Okay. Okay. Okay. Now I'm kind of looking at... So you're... You get extra help on your medications. That's the program. That's what it's called. It hasn't changed since 2014. So you can see it that far back. So your medication prices won't change from year to year. Those will always be the same. Now, yeah, right. Exactly. Right. Right. So we're going to get this fixed. The other thing is though, it doesn't matter. Regardless, you have extra help. So you could switch to a 16 different plans. But the price of your medications are set in stone. So that's interesting to me at the pharmacy said that. And to be honest, once this is over, maybe we can try and give them a call and see what they need to fix that. So what were they trying to target you? Right. Yeah. Yeah. You were just moved off of it. So yeah, I totally get that. Okay. I'm taking a peek at a couple things here. That way it can get you kind of better benefits anyway. So let's see. Okay. Sure. I can look. So I see, so you said it's on what street because I see north belt. I see Belleville crossing street and then Illinois street. Okay, north belt. Yeah. They're a preferred network too. So yeah, it's just definitely this change that they, that was put in here. I'm sorry about that. All right. Let's get you set up then. So. My name is Gabrielle. Yeah. Right. That's what I'm doing right now. Who is your primary care doctor? Can you spell that for me? Okay. Let me see. A-M-P-U-V-U. Okay. Do you see any other doctors or just that doctor? Do you see them all through rush? No, it's through the rush medical group. Right. Right. But between you and I, anytime you get on a plan with us, we have to do stuff like this. If we don't do this, then we can't enroll. It's just how it works. You know what I mean? Even if it was done in air. No, you have been enrolled, but I'm saying anytime you do a new enrollment. So this is a new scenario. You know what I mean? We had to go over doctors. You got to go over meds. It's just required. Yeah. Trust me. I wouldn't want to do anything. I'm in the same boat as you. So as your doctor's first name, it's the A-L-E-T-H-E-A. Okay. Yeah, they're not coming up. A, are you sure that's right? Right. Okay. Okay. That helps, actually. Okay. Okay. Oh yeah, you're right. You know your stuff. Okay. But you do see specialists or no. Okay. All right. I see this one. Okay. I found Clara and the other doctors. Okay. Okay. We got somewhere. Okay. Now, with your primary or with the specialist, do you know where you go for that specialist? I don't need a name. Do you have like a street? Anything? Okay. And there are what type of doctor? Final. Okay. Final. Okay. Martin Greenberg. Are air in Greenberg? I think there's a lot of the Greenbergs. They're a whole family. Let's see. Yeah. Yeah. Go ahead. You're good. I know this kind of sucks. Greenberg. You see them in Illinois. Right. Okay. I think it's Jacob Greenberg. He's a neural surgeon. Is that sound right? Yeah. You're funny. Jake. What did you say? I'm sorry. Okay. Yeah. Now, it doesn't. Actuallydammit. Yeah. And then let me see this. That's eight. 80. Okay, then looking at your doctors, then you'll have a little bit of dental on here, not that if you care or you don't care, but you'll have dental on here. It's $3,000 for your dental, okay? You should not have any co-pays because you got Medicaid. So, if you go to a specialist or anything like that and they tell you have co-pays, you say no, I have Medicaid, okay? But you seem like you stick up for yourself, so that's good. Then your vision, I'm, it's good to hear that though. Your vision, you can use that also if you want to. It'll have $300 on it, okay? So, you've got vision on here, you'll have dental, your urgent care. If you want to go to urgent care, that'll be free. So, your Medicaid should pick up any costs on our side. Does that make sense? Yep. Yep. So, you'll be able to see it all, but remember what you see on here, so things like your specialists, it'll say that your specialists are $30, but that's if you don't have Medicaid, but you have Medicaid, okay? So, Medicaid picks up that cost. Same with hospital. It'll say that your hospital's $275 for days, one through eight, but what did I say? You have Medicaid, they pick up that cost for you. So, none of that stuff, you're like, I worry about. You're going to have over the counter, too, too. So, okay, so, okay, ma'am, but you know, I can't just quickly enroll you, you know what I mean? We got to go over this stuff, or else they won't let me send it through. No. No, I'm sorry. Okay. Right, but we got it. It can't just automatically get sent. We have to enroll you. Yes, exactly. Okay, what drugs are you on? What doctor, or what prescriptions do you take? Okay, can you grab those for me because I need them. I need the names of the meds. Okay, you don't have any old prescription bottles. Okay, I got that one. Xanax. I can't call the pharmacy because I'm not you. You know what I mean? I can't ask them to give me your medications. Okay. Metform. Okay. Trust me, I understand. You just want to get it done and over with. I get it, but I can't, I can't do this, you know, without your consent. You know what I mean? Without you on the phone with me. Okay, you said you got Xanax. I got three medications. Add it on here. You take anything for like sleep or anything like that. Xanax, just a sleep. Okay. Okay. Easy enough. Okay. Okay. 10 milligrams. Okay. All right. I got that. All right. Let me just add this last one, the heart medicine. Okay. All right. I got that added. So yeah, all your medications are tier one drug. So you shouldn't really be paying much for any of those medications. And if they say otherwise, you know, they're not really telling the truth. Now, is Clara, is Clara the wife? Is she the one that you typically see or you see her husband? Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. Okay. Right. Right. Okay. Let me get her an expansive number she's got here. Okay. Three, seven, zero, three, four, one, one. Yep. Okay. And then you go to Washington University Hospital, right? If you were going to go to the hospital, Belleville Memorial. Okay. Okay. Right. Right. Okay. Specialist is Greenberg. Okay. I got all that figured out. I got this down. All right. You've been on Medicare since 2003. Alrighty. Fixing that all up here. No apartment number, right? All right. It's making sure no one messes with you. All right. Got that down. All right. Next question. Are you the, do you know how to use your phone? Like if I sent you a text message right now, would you be able to open it up while we're still on the phone or no? Okay. Sweet. Okay. This will be a lot quicker this way since you like to be quick on the same way. So we'll do it this way. Okay. So the name of the plan that I'm putting you on, so when you see it, you don't get confused. It's called the Wellcare No Premium Essential HMO.
