But just mentioned, okay, I do have different plan that you're going to get double what you currently have. So that's what I'm saying. You know, you are not getting the most benefit you suppose to get. Hold on. Okay. Yeah. Let me go over the, you know, the detail with you. Okay. So for the vision, hold on. Okay. Yeah. Uh, yes. Now it's our open enrollment period. You can switch. No. No. Since you already know you are not going to get penalty anything. Okay. Because you do have one time, you know, you can switch during our open enrollment period, especially. Go ahead. It's no, it's same carrier. Okay. It's where care. It's just different plan. Uh-huh. It just give you more benefit. Yeah. It's same carrier. Okay. Give me one second here. Okay. Hold on. Okay. So I do have one of the Medicare advantage plan here. Okay. It's called where care.

Well, unfortunately, that's not the case. Yeah. You had $225 medical deductible. Um, yeah. And for the maximum out of pocket is US is very high to the is 5900, right? Yeah. So the plan I'm going to present it to you for the maximum out of pocket is only $3,450. Okay. So it's nest number 50. All right. So let me cover the rest of the benefit with you. Okay. So for your primary care doctor, okay, it's as a data. Okay. So it's TPO plan. So you do have flexibility to see in our network data. Okay. So it's a lot of copy for you. And for the specialty data, $30 copay, all right. And for the dental, okay, you do get to 1500, all right, a $0 copay for preventive and $0 copay for comprehensive identity starter in network. Okay. So this is going to save you a lot of money to because the plan you currently have only to a thousand and you do have 40% core insurance for you need to pay down. And for the vision, this plan is going to give you $200 is that $100. Okay. And you're also going to get a spendable card, too. Okay. So on the spendable card, you're going to receive $33. Okay. Every month. So if you're getting $40 every quarter, you're going to receive $33 every month. So if you add every quarter, you're going to get $99. But this going to, you know, every month. Okay. 33. So you can use that, okay, to over the counter item, like vitamin, Tylenol, Avio, and kind of pain relief medicine. Or you can use that to pay all the pocket cost on your dental vision or hearing aid. Okay. So for example, okay, if you're getting a glass, cost you more than $200. You can use the spendable card to pay to that. You don't have to pay all the pocket cost. Yeah. So this is give you more, you know, flexibility to use the flex car. Okay. Oh, yeah, definitely. And just mentioned, you know, the monthly allowance is not going to expire. Okay. It's going to lower over to the following months. So it's going to end, you know, expire at end of the year. Okay.

Yeah, it's that every quarter. So this give you much more, you know, money on the spendable. No, no, no, every month, not every quarter, every month, you're going to receive $33. So the plan you currently have, you're getting every three months, right, $40. But this one is give you every month is that every quarter, okay. And you do have more flexibility, you know, how you use that. So you decide over the counter item, you can use that to pay any out of pocket course for your dental vision or CLA.

Customer-Channel 0(LEFT):  Hi, my fair. I'm calling regarding my vision coverage, my vision insurance. I know that I have, so I have, should I give you my number, my insurance card number? Okay. Okay. Or again. 9-7-213. Yes. Okay. Okay. Hold on a second. Let me see. Okay. Sorry. I used to carry it, but they had, um, um, I think it's changed now where they don't include your social security number on it, but they used to. And so, uh, like people were kind of told like, it's terrible with that card because that's not your social security number on it. And so. Okay. Okay. Okay. Then can I just give you my social security number? Yes. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Yes. Okay. Yes. 5-845, North East, Hoyt Street, number 410, Portland, Oregon, 9-7-213. Yes. Yeah. Right. Um, well, I, um, I have vision care. Correct. I have vision care with premier, like health net switched to a vision insurance. I have insurance company by the name of premier. Do you see that? Or do you have access to my vision benefits? Okay. Oh, well, the, um, the reason that I'm calling is because I need to have my, um, an eye exam. And I called and checked with premier, my, you know, the insurance and they said that I would leverage for an eye exam. And then I have $100 towards glasses. Yeah. And, um, so I made an appointment with a, um, preferred provider that accept premier. But there, the vision, uh, the doctor's office told me that the eye exam is covered, but they, the prescription, they do it separate and that I would have to pay $55. And they said that they showed that something like it was inactive. So what they were saying, like I didn't understand. And I had read reviews on this place and people were talking about they've never been somewhere where the prescription is separate from the exam. Like when you go and you get your eyes checked, you check your eyes. And then they write out what, you know, what's off the numbers, you know, like minus whatever they write out the prescription. And you're given that because that's why they did the exam to see what your vision is. But this place is charged $55. And they said it was because I don't have that I'm inactive or whatever that, I don't know what that means. Well, but, you know, I don't think that I can switch like, is this a time period that I could quit. But, but even though it a late isn't there like a late enrollment and then you get charged. Like, is this normal? So are you going to tell me? Are you going to tell me options different than well care health? Okay. Okay. No, I didn't know that. I thought I had like the cheapest and like the best. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Sounds way better than what I have. So it's $33 every how many months, four months, every month. So every quarter, so like every three months, every month. Wow. Okay. Okay. How do I use this? Perfect. And then for, I see a mental health provider. So that would be the $30 copay, right for a specialist. So that's what I pay now is $30. Okay. Okay. Sure. Okay. Uh-huh. 65? Okay. Okay. Well, what's the original care I'm the one that I currently have? Okay. Okay. So it's only five or more, but I think so much better. Okay. Okay. We're so great ahead. Yeah.
