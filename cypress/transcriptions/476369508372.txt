Agent-Channel 1(RIGHT):  Good morning, Ms. DeFilippo. This is Miranda from Clarematch, Medicare. How are you? I'm all right. I apologize for the late response, getting back to you. I was actually out for a couple of weeks, but I am back. I got a couple of messages from you. So I just wanted to touch base see what I could do to help. Okay, is it that you're not happy with the plan or you're not happy with the doctor that was given? I understand the frustration. I'm sorry about that. So here's what we can do. We can definitely get you back on your old plan. That's not a problem at all, but I hate to see you lose the benefits. Would you mind if I gave a couple of options for doctors a call and see if maybe I can get you an appointment sooner? Yeah, okay. No, I understand. I understand. I'm very sorry about that. So let's go ahead and pull everything up and we can get you switched right back into your well care plan. I was going to say, unfortunately, I wouldn't start immediately. It would start February 1st. All right, let me get everything pulled up here. Let me just a moment. My computer is kind of getting itself together. It hasn't been turned on for long. Just a moment. Now are we going to be, I'm very sorry. I haven't had any issues like that previously. Normally, doctors don't have such a long way list, but maybe because of the new year and people kind of switching plans and things. No, no, no, no. You have no problem going back to where you were. It's just a matter of doing. Kind of what we'll do is we'll go over your doctors and prescriptions again just to make sure everything is the same. And then I'll go over the plan details because I'm required to. And then I'll get you your applications sent over and you'll just redo it and it'll start February 1st. Yes, you would use the human for this month and then it would change for you in February. Now, let me go ahead and pull up. We liked you were on a couple of different well care plans. The last one we were on was the well care no premium. Did you like how that plan worked? Did you like the benefits that it was giving you? Yeah, let's go ahead and take a look. Yeah, we'll definitely take a look. And are we going to be doing this for you and your husband? Just take a look. And remind me again, the doctor you want to use. Let me go ahead and put her name in here. Let me take a look here. I'm just reviewing some of the plan options just to see if there's any kind of richer benefits. Yeah, now I understand. Let's see. Okay, so I do actually have one that's a little bit better than the one you were on previously. It is still with well care, but it is actually one of their well care dual plans since you do have the Medicaid. This plan is called the well care dual reserve. It is, yep. I don't believe so. It looks like the last two you were on were just standard Medicare Advantage plans. They weren't dual plans. This one would have been new for the area. So, all right, let's see. Let me go ahead and pull it back up here. So, this plan is going to work with your Medicaid benefits. So, you're still going to get really rich benefits for dental and vision. You're going to get an allowance card monthly. It's not going to be quite as much as it was with Humana, but you'll still have some kind of allowance there. And it keeps your co-pays pretty low as well. And then no, dental with this plan is actually going to be a $5,000 allowance. So, dental will be more with this plan and $400 for vision. Hearing is, it's going to be a $1,000 allowance per year. So, for hearing aids, you'll have a $2,000 annual total. So, we'll go ahead and go over the plan kind of top to bottom here. Can you remind me again, does your husband also have Medicaid? Okay. Okay, perfect. So, this will work for you both. And is he available to kind of listen in? Yeah, if he can just let me know that he's there for the recording. So, I can go over it with you both. And then that way, if you guys like it, I can get this perfect. Hi, Mr. Diffle of Bow. How are you doing? Good. So, we were just taking a look over the well-care plan options to kind of switch back to so you guys can use Dr. Watson. The one I was going to go over is called the Well-Care Dual Reserve. It is an HMO plan, so you guys will have your set primary care doctor, Dr. Watson. And you'll get referrals from her for any specialist that you see. So, I'm going to go ahead and go over the details for you kind of go down the list here. The plan itself does have a monthly premium. It's $37.70. However, you both have extra help. So, your extra help picks up that cost so you won't ever see it. There's no annual deductible with this plan, and it has a maximum out of pocket responsibility of 1,500. So, that means as far as copays go every time you pay a copay, it goes into a bucket. If it ever hit that $1,500, the plan caps you there and they pay 100% of cost after that. Right. With this plan for inpatient hospital coverage, it's $0 per day for unlimited amount of days outpatient. So, yes, it's down to $0 for 2024. Remember, this is a different plan than what you had previously. Yeah. So, $0 for this plan, and that's because of the fact that it's a dual plan, it works with your Medicare and Medicaid. Right. Outpatient is going to be a little bit different as well. $50 copays for outpatient kind of like any kind of outpatient services. If you have surgery centers are a little bit different. Surgery centers are 135. Actually, I'm sorry, I misspoke. 135 for outpatient observation, if you're in an emergency room. $50 for outpatient surgeries done at a hospital, $0 at a surgical center. Sorry. Doctors visits are going to be $0 for you, primary care and specialists. Preventative services are zero as well. Yep, colonoscopies, mammogram, diabetes screenings, annual wellness visits, vaccines, all of that good stuff. Yeah. Emergency room is 135, and urgent care is zero. Diagnostic test and services, $0 for lab services, $0 for other test and procedures, $15 for X-rays, and then $50 for radiology. That's things like MRI CT scan at scans. Hearing is $0 copays on routine hearing exams, and then again up to $1,000 allowance per year annually for hearing aids. Dental covers preventative and comprehensive, so your most basic oral exams and cleanings all the way to dentures, crowns, fillings, extractions, up to $5,000 each year. Vision is $0 copays on the exams, and a $400 allowance for any glasses or contacts you may need. Mental health is zero, skilled nursing facilities are $0 for the first 20 days. It does go up to $203 for days 21-30, and then drops back down to zero for 31-100. No, unfortunately not. You won't get that card with this plan. Let's see here. Physical therapy services, those are all going to be $0 for you guys. Ambula, yeah physical therapy, any kind of outpatient rehab, pulmonary, all of those types of rehabilitation services are going to be $0 for you. That is the skilled nursing. That was the $0 for the first 20 days, $203 per day for 21-30, and then 0-31-100. I believe it does when I just double check that. Yeah, I don't see why it wouldn't. I will double check on that for you though. Oh, yes they do, sorry. It's their wellness program. I don't think it's with stillverse sneakers anymore with well care, but they do have their fitness membership program. I'll get you the details on that. Let's see here. To do ambulance is going to be a $150 copay. This plan does offer transportation for you guys, 36 one-way trips per year, and the only stipulation with that is you have to schedule those at least 72 hours in advance. All right, doctors, the gym, pharmacy, any of those types of things. Yeah. What was that? Medicare part B drugs are also covered. That's things like chemo therapy drugs, any medications that are administered by a doctor in office, those have a 20% coinsurance. And then let me just verify your guys's prescriptions. I have Simvastatin, OZEMPIC, and Synthroid. I believe those are Simvastatin. Okay, and then I have the OZEMPIC and the Synthroid. All righty. So all of your guys's prescriptions are covered and you'll have $0 copays on those. Higher practice is covered up to 12 visits a year at a $0 copay. Pediatry is covered as well. $0 home health care is always covered up to 35 hours a week. Durable medical equipment like wheelchair is oxygen. Those have a 20% coinsurance. And then they do, like we said, have their wellness program. And then you have your wheelchair, they call it the wheelchair spendables card this year. It's $81 a month that each of you will receive. It does roll over to the next month if you don't use it and all of it would expire at the end of the year. You can use this for over the counter product. So like allergy medicine vitamins to paste toothbrushes. You can use it towards any overages with dental vision or hearing. So if you go over that allowance, you can use that that card to pay any remaining. But you can also use it towards healthy foods at the grocery store, gas if you're getting like pay at the pump gas utilities or rent. It's healthy food options. So you obviously can't get things like tobacco and alcohol or sodas, candy, but things like, you know, milk, produce, eggs, meats, all of those types of things. Absolutely, pay at the pump. Yeah. It won't be able to use if you go inside and use it at a cash register though, just like at the gas station. Yeah, it's going to look like a visa card. If you got your humana card, then it's going to pretty much look like that. Definitely use it. Yeah, use it up. And that kind of sums everything up. Any questions for me? Yeah, no, no. I really hope you don't either. Dr. Watson will be listed on your new card. So what we'll go ahead and do is get your application done. Let me go ahead and send this over. Are you guys comfortable filling out an application if I sent you a text message? Okay. Is that this telephone number or the one that ends in 6029? Okay. No, I can send both to the same number and you'll just fill them out separately. But let me go ahead and send yours over first. And then as long as Mr. Defilippo likes everything, we'll go ahead and send his over as well. Alrighty, perfect. I know I might have to come steal that card from you guys. Definitely. Let me go ahead and get this application sent over to you just a moment. Definitely take advantage of that allowance while you have it. Use it up. You know. Okay. And Ms. Defilippo, I'm sending this to 6029. Okay. Alrighty. I am sending yours over right now. So whenever you have that, go ahead and fill that application out. And if you have any questions, just let me know. I'm going to get my notes put in for you. And then I will send over his as well. Yeah, we can I'll get you actually the number on the back of your human ID card. You can call member services once we're done and they'll resend you out a allowance card. Okay, Mr. Defilippo, you should have that application. Perfect. So it should be pretty simple. All of it's really filled out for you so you can go ahead and go over it. And if anything needs to be updated or if anything is wrong, just let me know and I'll fix it. So it has to be done while we're on the phone because we do have to do our verification process at the end. No, you're fine. Oh, you're fine. A rush. Yeah, so that's already checked for you. Yes. Right, those are. You can leave that one blank. It's going to be zero. Yeah, and you'll go ahead and screenshot that just for your records. No, you can put no. I'm going to send you a different application for him. Oh, if you've already gotten the confirmation number, you can just exit that screen. And then give me just a second. I'm going to go ahead and get you his and over as well. And it's just going to be the same thing again for him. Okay, I am sending you his application right now. And actually, I think I have his number. 9031. Is that his cell phone? Do you want me to send it there? Would you rather me send it to your number? All right, I went ahead and sent his over as well. Yes, everything should be filled out there for you. Just those couple of questions. Thank you. Perfect. And then you guys are all set to go. Did you have any other questions for me? Perfect. Well, I'm glad I was able to help again. No, I understand. And I'm so sorry that you aren't able to get the doctors to let you in a little sooner. But hopefully this will fix things. You'll be able to use Dr. Watson and you'll be all set to go. And this is a great plan as well. So yeah, definitely. You definitely can. I mean, if you guys want an appointment for February, go ahead and call them. Let them know that you're switching insurance and that you'll have your ID number in about seven to ten days. And you can go ahead and make an appointment for February. No, you don't have to say any of that. You can just say that you, you know, you're switching insurance and you guys, you know, want to make an appointment. Yeah. Okay. Sounds good. Well, the pleasure speaking with you guys again. And if you ever have any questions, you have my number so don't hesitate to reach out. I will. I've been out. So I had surgery on the 13th of December. And I had some complications from it. So I was actually in the hospital until the 22nd. And I was back for maybe like two days before we went before we left again for the new year. So I apologize for that, but I am back and I'm good to go. So I'll be here. Of course, just a moment. Well, again, thank you. Happy new year and happy Merry Christmas to you guys as well. That's the wrong one. Bye.

Customer-Channel 0(LEFT):  Hello? Okay. How are you? Yes. I tried to establish a new patient with Dr. Bloom and he doesn't have anything until March. Then I started calling other doctors and they don't have anything until August. It's unbelievable. I just, being a new patient, I get, if I get sick, what's going to happen? That's a problem. They tell me to go to the walk-in. Really? So, I'm really not happy with the Umana. I want to go back to where we were. Any of them. I've tried six doctors. Nobody has anything. You can't even get in. I mean, one is March, one is August, one is September. Are you kidding? I'm like, no. This is not for me. I'm sorry. I have the doctor that I had. I mean, I'd call them. They'd have me in the day or the next day. I mean, this is ridiculous. Yeah, but is that going to help me? What happens if I'm sick? Or my husband gets sick. I mean, we have to go to a walk-in. I don't want that. I want to go to the doctor that I know. I mean, I never had a problem with well care. I never did. I'd call and I'd go in. And no, so it's just, you know, I'm not happy, period.
