Agent-Channel 1(RIGHT):  Good morning Miss Regina. I'm sorry. I didn't catch your name. I'm sorry. Good morning, ma'am. My name is Ruth Umprey, and I'm following up on a request that we receive for additional information from Melcare Medicare. All righty. And she looks like she went to the Medicare site on the third and we've been trying to reach her sense always apologize for the repeated calls. Do you? Oh, okay. And how can I help you this morning? Uh-huh. I'm not sure what what plan do you currently have now with her? Do you just plan having over the counter monthly stipend? Because that would that would be covered under that, where they give you either monthly or quarterly. I'm not sure. I would have to look up your plan. Do you want me to do that? Okay. And with your permission, um, can I look it up in the Medicare database? Okay. One moment while I log into it, being slow today. Excuse me. All right. Would you happen to have her Medicare card handy? Okay. Oh, good. Yep. Rest is good. Yep. Absolutely. Is it safe to say that you have the power of attorney for her? Okay. All right. Yeah. They don't use the letter. Oh, just before that fact. It's just easier for zeros. Okay. So let me read that back to you to make sure I typed it incorrectly. I have four MW five Q F is in Frank zero. You V is in Victor. Five two. Is that correct? Okay. All right. And she currently does not have a Medicare Advantage plan. That would have that coverage for you. So does she have Medicaid as well as medical? Okay. All righty. And let me get some more information. And I can go over some plans that could be available for her. And I do need to let you know that this call is being recorded for quality and training purposes as well as your protection. One moment isn't the right system here. Okay. And the zip code that you put in was two five or I'm sorry two nine five zero five. Is that correct? Okay. And you said she does receive Medicaid. And I had the birth date you put in of zero seven zero seven nineteen seventy seven. Okay. That's a lucky number there. And Regina spelled R-E-G-I-N-A-G-R-E-E-R. Okay. And would you happen to have the Medicaid card number? Okay. Because that would recommend it. Okay. I know it right. Don't they realize that some people that will be using the card like people like yourselves that are caring for someone else that they may need to have and bigger numbers. Oh wonderful. Wonderful. Okay. So she does qualify for the dual liberty plan which is our best plan. That's wonderful. All right. And what pharmacy do you use? Right. Oh absolutely. What was it called? Big O-T-H-E. There it is on Hofmeyer Road. Okay. All righty. And before we get in the prescriptions let's jump to doctors because it's most important that her doctors are a network. Who would be her primary care physician? She needs one. Okay. South Carolina House calls. And that's in Florence. Go to their websites. You know what happened to know who the doctor was that would come out or Gacha. Gacha. I don't know if the name of the doctor would be on any of her prescription bottles. Okay. Who's her N-P-C-O-O-P-E-R? Some of them have their own writing number. Their license. Okay. I have Janet Coopner Nurse Practitioner and it's an adult health gerontology. Well she's not using the address for the South Carolina home visit. She's using 1131 East Home Avenue in Hartstill. Okay. All righty. They may be rotating in for the some of the centers. Some doctors do that. They rotate in for clinics or you know care stuff like that. So they may rotate in. Okay. And she is your primary. She says not a primary care provider. She is a doctor but for but she's not a primary care physician. We would need to find out who the primary care is. Okay. Okay. And how do you spell? Do you know his first name? On Google. Okay. And oh I know. Okay. You're in the PD region. W. Okay. Let me look up that clinic that in Emma with the out of again. I'm sorry. Okay. Okay. Oh, gotcha. There he is. Dr. William Lorenz. William Dean. Okay. Yep. You have right. Yep. Absolutely. Okay. See if he goes by William Dean. And would you say he's within 20 miles or 10 miles? Right. Oh. Oh my goodness. Yeah. Oh yeah. Absolutely. Let me look up the cloud health. EOD. We do an advanced search here. Okay. And he is and he's occupational therapy, right? Gotcha. Gotcha. Okay. One we would need to go. Let's see. The cloud health. Let me go back. Insurance. Oh my goodness. Oh, I know a lot of people might not like her but major. Marjorie Green is holding hearings on COVID injured patients. She is the representative for Georgia. She and she is bringing in. She's holding hearings that in Congress about patients being injured by the COVID vaccine. Right. Right. Right. Wow. Yeah. My girlfriend's daughters both got really sick actually. And at the end of November, December, in 2019. And they couldn't figure out what was going on with the upper respiratory. And I mean, these girls were sick for six weeks. It took them and they're still not. They get they get upper respiratory really easy now. Okay. Unfortunately, I'm not finding him. But that doesn't mean he may or may not because she has Medicaid. He may just charge Medicaid versus the insurance plan. But I'm not finding him in our system. Let me look one other area provider. Oh, yeah. But a Medicaid what a Medicare advantage does is it gives you a little bit more like for vision, dental hearing, over the counter items like you're saying for the diapers and the bed pads. Whereas Medicare won't pay for those. The K does though. That's something that you could at call Medicaid and find out. William Dean Lorenz. additional. Oh, come on. Don't be slow now. Now I'm not I am not showing him in my network. The occupational therapist. But that doesn't mean you can't talk to him and see if he would accept it. Okay. Yep. And then you said you need to find a primary care. So you need a family doctor. Okay. Let me take a look and put it within 10 miles. Okay. Crescent health and where are they located? Crescent health. 214 Piedem Street. It is. Oh goodness. Let's see. Let's see. There don't have. I'm large my screen. There's like a slew of them in there. But I'm not sure who they are. There we go about us. Yep. There's a physician assistant nurse practitioners and then office staff. Let me see if any of these are. There's a Lindsay Howard. Let me go back. Oh wow. Well, just be glad you're not in Greenville because Greenville dropped the Greenville health system with the Greenville hospital on that. Draft United health care. Yep. And some of the people weren't even notified. Okay. So Lindsay is not listed. So let's see if Jennifer Reed is. Let me move it out a little bit. This goes by zip code, not actual address. Okay. So she's not listed either. Let me do an advanced search. And you prefer a female doctor? Right. Okay. So let me, I'm going to read off some addresses and you tell me if these are close enough to you. I have 960 public highway. Okay. I have a Latoya Lane Milo. She is a nurse practitioner but she does have her own writing license. Oh wait. We found Janet Cooper. Oh, she's not a primary though. That's right. Yes, ma'am. She's Latoya Lane Milo. Gold star urgent care is the office. Mm-hmm. And she's accepting news. Yeah, some of the doctors at urgent care also are a primary. Of course, that would do that. A, T is in town. O, Y, A, then then Lane L, A, N is a Nancy E hyphen Milo. M is a Mary I, L, O. Okay. So let's just put her notes. Correct. And I've got the number four if you'd like that. All righty. It's 843, 804, 6689. And she does have Sunday hours too, just so you know. Okay. What about, does she, anybody take care of her vision or her hearing? Okay. And do you have a dentist that you have in mind or would you like me to look up one? Okay. So let me, and probably a female dentist you think, just want to do whatever she's comfortable with. Okay. A dentist, not dentistry. Dentist. That would help. Oh my goodness. Okay. Okay. Let's see. There is a Bimla Garty. Now she's in Greenville. Is that far from you? I don't know how far Greenville is from Florence. Oh, that's too far. Oh, okay. Is Sumpter closed by? Okay. All righty. So let me, let me clear my selection then and see what we've got. Okay. Yeah. Let me go back. Yep. Let me do that. Okay. There's a Michele Pits with Brightstar Dental on 943 South Irby Street in Florence. Oh, Irby. Yep. Michele, M-I-C-K-E-L-L-E. Yep. Yes, ma'am. And the last name is P-I-T-T. And the office is called Brightstar Dental. And it's 6-7-3-0075. Oh, no. The hospital should replace it. Well, yeah, through that office, the lab that they use and everything they use would be in work. They wouldn't send it somewhere that isn't covered. No. Yeah. And then okay. And then what about her vision? When's the last time she had her eyes checked? Okay. Yes, ma'am. Okay. And what time would you like me to call you back? But okay, we'll do. You're welcome.

Customer-Channel 0(LEFT):  Hello. This is her mom. Liam. This is her mother. Okay. Okay. I can do it. That's okay. That would have been that would have been need to get that. With only thing I was looking at was like she has these diapers and the bed liners now after her recent visit to the hospital. So I didn't know if they would help cover that. Oh, I don't know. Oh, okay. Yeah. Oh, no. Yeah, I looked that up for me because I don't know if she does or not. Yes, yes, do that for me. Oh, I can use it. I'll stretch out, get me a little bit of a break since she was resting. Yeah, you have to get it when you can. Yes, yes, I did. Medicare card. A 4, M, W, 5, Q, F, S, Z row. You, you, V, 5, 2. Correct. Okay. Okay. Yes, she does. Okay. That's correct. Yes, no. That's where she's all sevens. Yep. That's where everybody says. That's correct. Oh, yes. 6, 6, 7, 8, 2, 5, 4, 6, 9, 9, 8. Why did they make the numbers of Louis thing on the cards? The smallest. Some of the drugstores did start printing bigger numbers on the retail numbers, you know, on prescriptions because they were so tiny you couldn't already read them, you know, so they finally got where they were printing them bigger for people. So, we used D, pharmacy, here in Florence. I like to support a hometown, pharmacy, student, big ones. D, K, H, D. That's it. Okay, what she don't have one. We use a Maris, we use a Maris and we use a South Carolina house cause we don't really take her out to a doctor. Yes. No, I do not. She, she corresponds with a doctor, but I have a np that comes out on this practitioner that comes out. Let's see. No, her np names on there. Janet Cooper. Yeah, they did because she does. She has no products and everything and she pays care of it all. We use really don't know what her home address is because I guess that would be her though. So, yeah, the only actual doctor that she sees is a doctor Lorenz. He's actually a, he works with, again, what do you guys have? Yeah, maybe in office, he's tiny, in office rehab. He sent her original prescriptions. He's not a, he's not a, he's not a general doctor. He's an occupational, something doctor, but it's L-O-R-E-N-Z. D-D-N, I believe. I looked him up in the night on Google. Let's see on these original prescriptions from CBS, what they got on here. Here we go with this tiny print again. No, it says, do you? I do, Lorenz. Yeah. He has his own office on she base to that C-H-E-D-E-S and Florence. He's tied him to the office hospital or rehab center. His office is right next to the rehab center. It's Dr. William Lorenz because he went to school in California. We were looking up this education. He's a William Dean. We're at wrong. He's a William Dean. We're at right. See, he's within 10 miles of us. Yeah. He's like, okay, he's right there at some cloud hospital. So, yeah, he's within 10 miles. That's one reason we just moved in October because of her and all these doctors. So, Lorenz, you didn't go to the hospital. So, we didn't get out to do anywhere. She got sick and had to go back in the hospital, but I was so glad we lived here, because we were in a very small town that didn't have a very good hospital or doctor. So, now she's in a much better place. Is that Palmetta? Another cloud hospital, Palmetta. It's in the L-E-O-D. Yeah, he's occupying you. He's not a general doctor. He's the only one that we go out of the house to see. And it does just move and we have not set up. I haven't even set up a general doctor yet. So, you know, she spent 54 days in the cloud in 2020. Let's make you have strokes. You have a stroke that was coped, coped, related. Yes. Marjorie Green, who was she? Oh, okay. Yeah, because when Regina went in January of 2020, there was not even a test for COVID. They knew COVID was out there. The first was so early in January that hers was strictly guesswork. I mean, the cloud had to airlift or to the cloud because we didn't live here at the time. They literally saved her life. They told her she could write the book on COVID now because she had every symptom. But back then, you know, they didn't know what COVID was. Well, we didn't have a test for it. And then when we got out in March of 2020, they were just going on lockdown because of COVID. But Regina was one of the very first ones to actually have COVID. Yeah. Right. And other than that, if you're spending time on her bills without lowering. Right. Well, we actually go to him tomorrow. I could talk to him and see. Yeah, we had talked with Crescent Health. Are they in your network? They have not set to this yet, but I did talk with them. I think on street with what it said. It's not the block or two often hospital knowledge of the map. Yep. Yeah. What in my name is good today. I got notes everywhere in the sale. But you know what? I think they both nurse practitioners. And we've really had a hard time because a lot of people in front are not set to meet patients. I've tried several places, you know, like where my daughter and so on, I'll go and keep on nailing and they're not set to meet patients. Oh, my goodness. Oh, goodness. Because that's where I care. You know, I help care. I think she would be more comfortable with one. Yeah. And I'll take her back to me because they're probably just going to need to see her once a year because home health would take care of everything else that we needed. You know, so I don't think there'd be a problem with taking her once a year and just letting the physician check her over, you know. I don't know. That's close. But the other one is on camera. So she works for her care. All right. I'm going to grab another pin and you know, I'm going to start writing right in the middle of this. Okay. Spear her name for me first of all. I'm going to go to the bio. Okay. Got it. Got it. And she's a gold star urgent care. Okay. Sit. Sit. I got eight in there. 20. I'm going to do this. Okay. All right. I can check with her again. I'm going to have to call you back. I think I make sure all this goes through. But no. See, all that's been still paid her vision and she has a lot of dental work that needs to be done. You'll be nice to have some dental coverage. We do not know a dentist here. Do you want to go to a dental dentist? In a way, and keep picking it up. We're in Florence, three hours. Yeah. We're down towards the middle of each. Deal. That'd be a drive. That'd be our picking. Keep going. You've got to be something in Florence. It's a big old town. Could you flip the zip code in? 295. 05. We live off of Irby. So that's cut and be convenient. Yep. We live right off of Irby. All right. So it's South Irby. R-B-Y. In the name of, let me show you, but you've got a K in there. K-L, okay? Okay. Okay. 843. Okay. 075. Okay. I know you have to have a bridge work done in the front of your mouth. You used to wear a partial. I was going to replace the partial because I lost it in the hospital. Believe it or not. So I guess anything that he would have to send out, we would just have to make sure it was in network, right? You know, a lot didn't send their stuff. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I've been two years. Don't let me tell you who... Okay. I just went. Let me... Hold on. Look at Google. Okay. Where I went. And I believe they'd probably be a network. Can I actually do me a favor? Can you call me back? Because one for nurses is calling. And they didn't call it one time. And I hate to ignore the second time. Maybe five minutes. Five minutes. That's coming back. Thank you. Hello.
